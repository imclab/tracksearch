00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940

00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,260
IAN ELLISON TAYLOR:
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,630
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,680
I want to thank everyone who
made it down to Mountain View.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,670
It looks like we got a pretty
packed house tonight.

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,190
That's pretty good.

7
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,840
Hopefully, it wasn't
just for the beer.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,770
And of course, we have
an audience on video

9
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,770
conference from Asia.

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,890
I'm assuming they can see us,
since I can't see them.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,590
But anyway, thank
you for coming.

12
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,910
Hopefully, you'll have a fun and
interesting evening about

13
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,460
Native Client.

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,660
So to rewind just a little bit,
I think Google's fairly

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,250
well known for being a little
bit obsessed about

16
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,630
performance.

17
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,640
And so two, three years ago,
someone posed the question of

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,630
what would it be like if we
could run native code inside

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,820
the browser?

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,883
And that seemed like a really
interesting question, and it

21
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:52,890
sort of broke down into two main
goals for that, that we

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,920
started really investing in.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,380
The first, of course, was how
to bring native applications

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,730
to the web in terms of
performance and the power.

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,640
But also maintaining what's good
about the web in terms of

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,150
security and portability, so
that was goal number one.

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,170
Goal number two was really
about enriching the web

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,680
ecosystem by bringing a lot
of other programming

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,350
languages to the web.

30
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,430
Particularly programming
languages that had been around

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,440
and were in popular use,
and had been in popular

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,020
use for a long time.

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,110
So that started a long road,
and I think it was pretty

34
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,920
entertaining, and we've come
a long way I think in those

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,360
three years.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,860
So to talk a little bit more
about the technology and the

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,950
goals, I'm going to start with
the technical lead for Native

38
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,732
Client, Brad Chen, come on up.

39
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:47,088
[APPLAUSE]

40
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:49,060
BRAD CHEN: Thank you, Ian.

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,450
And thanks to all of
you for coming to

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,880
Mountain View this evening.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,550
On the engineering side of this
project, we had two main

44
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,520
problems we needed to solve.

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,530
Of course, we had to make Native
Client safe, to protect

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,110
users from the kinds of
problems that have

47
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,550
historically been common
with native

48
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,880
applications and native plug-ins.

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,270
We were painfully aware of the
history of security issues

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,010
that have arisen with
technology, such as NPAPI and

51
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,840
ActiveX, and we were determined
to learn the right

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,450
lessons from those systems.

53
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,880
But security alone is not
enough, obviously.

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,470
We needed to make a system
that was powerful.

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,480
We needed to make a system that
would enable developers

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,830
to deliver applications that
were new and exciting, but

57
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,520
that weren't already happening
on the web.

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,630
Now, in the three or so years
that have transpired since we

59
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,970
first started the research
project, we've made

60
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,310
significant progress towards
solving these problems. With

61
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,040
our Chrome 14 release, we've
shipped a browser that allows

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,090
application developers to ship
real applications using the

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,740
Native Client sandbox.

64
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,120
Together with a core set of
Pepper interfaces that support

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,940
facilities such as 2D graphics,
real-time audio

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,540
playback, URL loading, and
asynchronous messaging with

67
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,240
JavaScript.

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,410
And we've really enjoyed seeing
our early adopter

69
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,500
developers deliver vintage
arcade games to Native Client

70
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,140
on the web, by porting
emulators

71
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,880
like MAME and DOSBox.

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,080
In our more recent release,
we've actually added some more

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,070
ambitious and yet very
important features.

74
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,350
One really key feature is

75
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,610
hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.

76
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,620
This enables developers to
do real-time rendering of

77
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,750
detailed scenes, providing the
kinds of rich interactive

78
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,820
experience that we're all trying
to deliver these days.

79
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,000
We also provide sandbox
local file storage.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,780
This is a critical feature for
developers who want to provide

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,430
a really great user experience,

82
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,940
both online and offline.

83
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,390
It enables application
developers to provide

84
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,130
applications that
start quickly.

85
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,370
Because graphics, audio, and
other kinds of application

86
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,410
data are stored once on the
local disk, and so they're

87
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,770
already available the next time
the application starts.

88
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,090
We also provide, in our most
recent releases, dynamic

89
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,450
loading and the popular GNU libc
implementation, making it

90
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,390
that much easier
to port complex

91
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,210
applications to Native Client.

92
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,380
I'd also like to mention
full-screen

93
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,970
mode and mouse capture.

94
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,640
These are critical features
for application developers

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,260
that are trying to provide a
truly immersive experience.

96
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,280
The result of all of this is
that today, through Native

97
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,950
Client, application developers
can use native code safely in

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,890
Chrome across all popular
desktop operating systems. And

99
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,490
they have access to a rich and
growing set of resources from

100
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,340
the browser.

101
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,360
So with that, I'd like to
introduce Erik Kay.

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,110
Erik is an engineering manager
for Native Client, and he's

103
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,800
going to tell us a little bit
more about what this means for

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,090
developers and for the web.

105
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,825
Erik.

106
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:29,775
[APPLAUSE]

107
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,220
ERIK KAY: Thanks, Brad,
and hi everyone.

108
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,060
So you've heard that developers
are now going to be

109
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,470
able to bring their native code
to the web, but what does

110
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,370
that really mean for
the web at large?

111
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,550
Well the first thing is, is that
it means that decades of

112
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,940
native code that's been built,
and the expertise that comes

113
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,010
with it, and those millions of
developers who are experienced

114
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,850
in developing native code, can
now bring that to the web.

115
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,330
It'll now be an easy decision
for them to decide to port

116
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,890
their applications to the web,
because they no longer have to

117
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,950
rewrite them from scratch
in HTML and JavaScript.

118
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,940
There's now no reason why
many desktop and mobile

119
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,220
applications can't also
run on your browser.

120
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,920
We're also going to enable
higher performance computing

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
on the web.

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,920
Now, native code, running in
NaCl will often run multiple

123
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,060
times faster than JavaScript
today, and that's in

124
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,870
single-threaded mode.

125
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,800
But Native Client also has
access to efficient

126
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,840
multi-threading, which means it
can take full advantage of

127
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,430
your multi-core CPUs.

128
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,600
This is going to enable a wide
variety of applications that

129
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,480
weren't possible on
the web before.

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,830
Now, it's going to do this while
maintaining the security

131
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,400
model of the web today.

132
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,950
Now the main reason for this
is the sandbox that Brad

133
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,220
mentioned earlier.

134
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,870
But it's also because of our
philosophy and what kind of

135
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,910
APIs that we've brought
to Native Client.

136
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,910
Unlike previous technologies,
like NPAPI and ActiveX, we're

137
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,630
not bringing new capabilities
to the web.

138
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,010
Instead, what we're bringing
is the web capabilities to

139
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,050
Native Code.

140
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,550
Now this means that Native Code
will run with the same

141
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,940
security level as JavaScript.

142
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,720
Now we believe the applications
you're going to

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,660
see tonight are going to
demonstrate the real need for

144
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,490
this technology.

145
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,590
It's bringing applications
that were never before

146
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,000
possible on the web.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,030
And as such, we think it's
important for this technology

148
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,900
to not be limited to
a single browser.

149
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,920
We've developed Native Client
from the beginning in the

150
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,630
public as an open source
project, and are committed to

151
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,970
working with other browser
vendors to

152
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,320
bring it to all users.

153
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,070
We work closely with the open
source community, accepting

154
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,460
external contributions, and
we're looking forward to

155
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,610
continuing that close
relationship.

156
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,180
Now that's what it means for
the web, but what about for

157
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,420
developers?

158
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,090
Well, one of the big problems
developers have today is that

159
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,450
there are so many platforms
out there.

160
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,260
You're having to develop for
Windows, for Mac, maybe iOS,

161
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,970
and Android, maybe a game
console, then there's the web.

162
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,400
This often involves you having
to maintain multiple

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,290
development teams, multiple
code bases--

164
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,540
trying to keep them all in
sync is a very expensive

165
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,670
proposition.

166
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,550
With Native Client, you're now
going to be able to leverage

167
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,400
your existing code base,
and quickly and easily

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,940
bring it to the web.

169
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,880
We've seen already developers
bring million line code bases

170
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,280
to Native Client, in just a
couple of weeks and a handful

171
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
of developers.

172
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,720
And that's including the time
necessary to just learn the

173
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,370
technology to begin with.

174
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,250
Now, for many developers, the
best part is going to be the

175
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,246
fact that now on the web you're
going to be able to use

176
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:46,960
your favorite programming
language.

177
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,750
You don't need to
learn new stuff.

178
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,090
You can leverage your existing
knowledge, your existing

179
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,670
tools, your existing technology
that you've spent

180
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,390
so much time and effort
investing in.

181
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,870
And further, it's important to
remember that development is

182
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,750
not just about writing code,
it's also about the

183
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,090
tools behind it.

184
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,930
You have build systems, testing,
revision control--

185
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,200
all of these systems will work
seamlessly with your existing

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,860
code base and Native Client.

187
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,730
So once you've built your
application, you need to

188
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,780
distribute it.

189
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,210
We're here to help
with that too.

190
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,750
Today, you can build your app,
publish it in the Chrome web

191
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,080
store, and have direct access to
the rapidly growing Chrome

192
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,790
user base, now well over
200 million users.

193
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,020
This is a pretty exciting
group--

194
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,900
a pretty large user
base already--

195
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,440
but pretty soon you'll be able
to grow to an even larger

196
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,820
audience, and deliver them
directly via the web.

197
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,170
Now obviously, all these new
apps that you're going to see

198
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,930
today are going to have
huge impact on users.

199
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,820
To talk about that in more
detail is Christian, our

200
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,440
product manager.

201
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,200
[APPLAUSE]

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,210
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: Thanks,
Erik, and hi everybody.

203
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,040
So as Erik mentioned, Native
Client really enables

204
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,100
applications that just wouldn't
be possible before.

205
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,770
Either because they were too
performance demanding, or

206
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,040
simply because of the time
it would require to

207
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,090
rewrite these apps.

208
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,800
And so there's several
categories of applications

209
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,705
that we feel are really a
natural fit for Native Client.

210
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:33,970
The first category
is the games.

211
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,750
In particular, 3D accelerated
games, computationally

212
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,140
intensive games, and in fact,
many of the early adopters

213
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,480
that you're going to see here
today at the demo stations in

214
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,410
the back are games,
and there's a

215
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,570
good reason for that.

216
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,670
Games are a category that
traditionally push the

217
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,430
boundaries of what's possible
on a platform--

218
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,620
in this case, the
web platform.

219
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,550
Other categories are photo
editing, video

220
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,390
editing, image editing.

221
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,150
Imagine anything that involves
image transformations,

222
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,310
computationally intensive
filters,

223
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,730
anything along those lines.

224
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,310
Another category
is 3D modeling,

225
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,930
interactive training software--

226
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,740
and in fact, we have
a company that does

227
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,090
exactly that here today.

228
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,290

229
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,240
Another category would be
computer aided design.

230
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,820
Again, you have this conjunction
really of 3D

231
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,540
modeling and heavy
computation.

232
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,100
The same applies for
another category,

233
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,030
namely scientific computing.

234
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,780
So math, statistics, protein
folding, signal processing,

235
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,490
anything along the lines--

236
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,380
anything that you would classify
as heavy number

237
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,550
crunching would be a great
fit for Native Client.

238
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,670
So, of course, most of the users
are not going to care

239
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,460
about using Native Client, or
even know that they're using

240
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,780
Native Client.

241
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,730
What they're going to care about
is the fact they get

242
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,440
applications that are as feature
rich and as responsive

243
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,890
as desktop applications.

244
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,930
Yet they're synchronized across
all their machines

245
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,520
seamlessly, so they don't have
to install them several times.

246
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,790
They're also going to care
about the security.

247
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,300

248
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,370
Because Native Client is
as safe as other web

249
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,450
applications, you can run them,
install them, knowing

250
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,210
that your system is
going to be safe.

251
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,530
And incidentally, the install is
a frictionless process, and

252
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,110
you are not going to need admin

253
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,625
privileges on your machine.

254
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,170

255
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,400
So we've been working closely
with several early adopters of

256
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,370
Native Client.

257
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,750
And next I'd like to invite a
couple of them up here on

258
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,540
stage and talk about
their experience

259
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,310
using Native Client.

260
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,880
First, I am honored
and privileged to

261
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,560
introduce Yoichi Wada.

262
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,670
He is the CEO and President
of Square Enix, one of the

263
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,800
largest global game companies.

264
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,268
So please help me welcome
Yoichi Wada.

265
00:12:55,268 --> 00:13:04,730
[APPLAUSE]

266
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,660
YOICHI WADA: Thank you very
much for inviting me to an

267
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,710
occasion as momentous as
today's announcement.

268
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:17,970
I can say it's a great honor
to be here with all of you.

269
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,060
I'm convinced that Google's
Native Client will be welcomed

270
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,740
worldwide as a truly innovative
technology.

271
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,720
Not only for the IT industry,
but for the

272
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,230
games industry as well.

273
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,640
Video games are capable of
expressing rich experiences,

274
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,230
and are deeply loved by players
around the globe.

275
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,530
However, they are also
incredibly complex

276
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,210
applications, and until
recently playing games

277
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,055
required specialized consoles
intended for that purpose.

278
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:57,650

279
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,630
We in the game industry have
strived to present games on

280
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,970
general purpose devices to bring
joy to greater numbers

281
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,060
of customers.

282
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,920
Through the [? pleasure ?]

283
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,790
games and the social games
played in the browser, many

284
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,890
people who had previously not
played games have entered the

285
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,140
gaming world.

286
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,380

287
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,070
But browser technology
limited us to

288
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,320
offering very simple products.

289
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,050

290
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:39,620
Google's Native Client
solves this problem.

291
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,300
We are releasing a port of Mini
Ninjas as our first step

292
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,020
with Native Client.

293
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,280
We have prepared a demo
of the game today.

294
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Please give it a try, and ask
our developers about their

295
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,620
experience porting the game.

296
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,140

297
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,310
The feeling is something
that is

298
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,510
difficult to put into words.

299
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,320
You can't tell the difference
between playing on Native

300
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,170
Client and playing on
a game console.

301
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,840
Through this porting work, we
became convinced that Native

302
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,910
Client is an excellent solution
for browser gaming.

303
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,120

304
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,560
I should point out that I don't
believe that games with

305
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,700
console-level quality are
superior, or that such games

306
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,575
should be played by
all consumers.

307
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:39,390

308
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:45,810
My point is that, given that
consumers have varied tastes,

309
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,240
we should present a wide
variety of games.

310
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,440
All the first-class businesses
offer a wide selection of

311
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,005
choices to consumers.

312
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,820

313
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,000
With Native Client, the games
industry has been able to

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,690
realize this for
the first time.

315
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,190
Furthermore, what is important
about Native Client to gaming?

316
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,440
It's not just that you can
present a game to the same

317
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,560
level of quality as
a game console.

318
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,270
What is critical is the
fact that Chrome is,

319
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,070
above all, a browser.

320
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,630

321
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,210
The combination of browser and
console quality gaming will be

322
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:41,110
the impetus for social features
within these games,

323
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,160
to evolve far more rapidly
than has ever

324
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,190
been possible before.

325
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,500
It is incredibly exciting to be
able to work with Google in

326
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,830
expanding rich game experiences
around the world.

327
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,610

328
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,990
Let us begin this new
era together.

329
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,004
Thank you.

330
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:13,390
[APPLAUSE]

331
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,349
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: I'm just
going to repeat one thing,

332
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,720
which is, go have a
look at the game.

333
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,200
It's on the demo stations
after this, and it's a

334
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,900
gorgeous game.

335
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,329
So, really, check it out.

336
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,490
Our next presenter
is Amir Rao.

337
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,310
He is the Studio Director
of Supergiant Games.

338
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,110
And he's going to talk a
little bit about their

339
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,220
experiences porting their
award-winning game, Bastion,

340
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,470
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

341
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,740
Native Client.

342
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,990
Everybody, Amir Rao.

343
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:45,384

344
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:47,690
AMIR RAO: I'm Amir, this
is Greg, we're

345
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,730
from Supergiant Games.

346
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,500
Supergiant Games is a small,
independent developer with

347
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,045
seven people.

348
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:55,300
It's located in San Francisco,
California.

349
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,090
We actually started in the
living room of a house in

350
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,150
2009, and over the course of
20 months we built Bastion,

351
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,220
which we released on Xbox Live
Arcade and PC this summer in

352
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,940
conjunction with Warner
Brothers.

353
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,670
And since then, people
have been asking us

354
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,390
what we're up to.

355
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,520
And actually, one of the things
we've been up to is

356
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,160
Bastion for Chrome.

357
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,390
So We're just going to show the
game running in a browser

358
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,255
so you can see it
for yourself.

359
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:24,550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

360
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,490
-Proper story's supposed to
start at the beginning.

361
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,320
Ain't so simple with this one.

362
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,270
Now here's a kid whose whole
world got a little twisted,

363
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,820
leaving him stranded on
a rock in the sky.

364
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,670
He gets up, sets off for the
Bastion, where everyone agreed

365
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,130
to go in case of trouble.

366
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,460
Ground forms up under his feet
as if pointing the way.

367
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,970
He don't stop to wonder why.

368
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,880

369
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,990
He finds his lifelong friend
just lying in the road.

370
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,580
Well, it's a touching reunion.

371
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:04,480

372
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,550
He sees what's left of
the rippling walls.

373
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,780
Years of work undone in an
instant in the calamity.

374
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,855

375
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,988
Is that a survivor?

376
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:21,980
No ma'am, it's a Gasfella forced
out from underground.

377
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,974

378
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:29,465
The kid pops him good-- fella
got a piece of him though.

379
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:32,459
And then, he falls
to his death.

380
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,885
I'm just fooling.

381
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:34,310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

382
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,560
AMIR RAO: So yeah.

383
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,640

384
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,420
So for those you who've played
Bastion on other platforms,

385
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,460
that may look familiar.

386
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,980
And that's kind of what's so
exciting to us about it, is

387
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,100
it's the same sort of rich
narrative experience that you

388
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,210
get on your console, or on the
PC version of the game right

389
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,760
inside your browser.

390
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,660
The other exciting thing for us
was bringing the game to a

391
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,750
whole new audience.

392
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,900
And to welcome that audience,
we added a new mode to

393
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,420
Bastion, which we call 'no
sweat mode.' It basically

394
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,275
allows you to experience the
audio and art and story of

395
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,510
Bastion with reduced
combat difficulty.

396
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,810
And also, we kind of were
relishing the technical

397
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,150
challenge of putting the
game on a new platform.

398
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,200
And with Google support
we got into a browser

399
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,390
in about two months.

400
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,400
So yeah, it's a really
exciting time for us.

401
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,970
Today, right after I sit down,
we're going to put our version

402
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,870
of Bastion right on the Chrome
web store, so you'll be able

403
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,170
to play it.

404
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,170
And then tomorrow we're headed
off to LA for the Machinima

405
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,590
Inside Gaming Awards
and the Spike VGAs.

406
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,420
We're nominated for 10
categories across both shows.

407
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,670
And then tomorrow we're
announcing our new DLC for

408
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,863
Bastion, which actually will
appear on Native Client and

409
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:38,530
all other platforms.

410
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,940
So it's big week for us.

411
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,750
Thanks a lot to Google
for having us here.

412
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,350
And, yeah, you can come
play the game

413
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,710
and talk to our engineers.

414
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,075
Five of our team members
are here.

415
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:53,302

416
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:55,870
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN:
Thanks, Amir.

417
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,910
I've already spent quite a lot
of time playing Bastion for

418
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,350
testing purposes, obviously,
and so can you, apparently,

419
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,330
starting now.

420
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,480
So our next presenter is
something quite different.

421
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,640
I alluded to this before when
I said that you can do 3D

422
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,670
training in Native Client.

423
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,850
Our next presenter
is Neil Wadhawan.

424
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,350
He is the VP of Sales
and Marketing

425
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,806
from Heartwood Studios.

426
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:23,915
Welcome, Neil.

427
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,170
[APPLAUSE]

428
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,340
NEIL WADHAWAN: This my
colleague, Ryan Musta.

429
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,980
He's going to be helping
me with the demo today.

430
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,170
Heartwood is honored
to be here.

431
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,440
What we do is we support, help
our customers, enable them to

432
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,640
build, operate, repair, and do
maintenance, all in a 3D

433
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,270
interactive setting.

434
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,970
And we're using the Unity game
engine to develop our

435
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,930
applications.

436
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,800
We recently ported the
application to Native Client,

437
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,670
which the developers felt that
it was somewhat seamless.

438
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,590
It's still at its early stage,
but it definitely went well.

439
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,650
And we're going to demo an
application to you today.

440
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,270
Our customer, Sopogy, who is
a leading provider of solar

441
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,710
panels to the world, approached
us with a problem.

442
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,560
And their problem was, Neil, how
do we train and market our

443
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,560
product anywhere in the world
without having to send a field

444
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,480
service rep out every time
and spend that money?

445
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,430
So what we did at Heartwood is
we developed a 3D interactive

446
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,310
learning application
that solved

447
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,760
that problem for Sopogy.

448
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,580
Ryan, let's demo that.

449
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,250
So Ryan's going to load up a
lesson for you, and we're all

450
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,300
going to be able to assemble
this product after we're

451
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,840
done-- that's the goal, right?

452
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,290
And this is all, obviously,
running in the Chrome browser.

453
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,690
The rich fidelity is there.

454
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,990
We have parts here--

455
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:57,260
Ryan's going to start with the
anchor bolts, and move to the

456
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,810
stands, and so forth.

457
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,070
It's quite an in-depth lesson,
so we're not going to go

458
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,530
through the entire
procedure today.

459
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,040
But if you guys are really
curious and would like to

460
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,760
learn, please meet us at our
booth, and we'll teach you how

461
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,580
to put together this solar
panel in a 3D interactive

462
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,330
application.

463
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,070
One of the things we love about
Native Client, and being

464
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,090
able to port to it, is our
customers don't need to

465
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,900
download the Unity plug-in.

466
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,770
It's all native in the browser,
works seamlessly.

467
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,410
We're not going to get those
calls saying hey, this didn't

468
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,890
work, or that didn't work.

469
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,550
It's really nice and seamless.

470
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,100
It's secure.

471
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,990
And Ryan's going to preview the
product a little bit, show

472
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,370
you what it looks like after
it's been built--

473
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,870
that's the goal, what
it looks like.

474
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,950

475
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,440
So imagine a world where we
could all train in a 3D

476
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,430
interactive learning
application

477
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,900
that's in the browser.

478
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,560
For defense, military, heavy
machinery, medical.

479
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,090
There's countless industries
that we can serve.

480
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,090
So we're really excited
here at Heartwood.

481
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,630
We're honored to be at
Google and working

482
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,290
with you in this port.

483
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,470
We thank you for your time,
and appreciate it.

484
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,319
Thank you.

485
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:15,025
[APPLAUSE]

486
00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:17,810
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: Yeah, we
are very excited about seeing

487
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,160
something like Heartwood Studios
come on Native Client,

488
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,570
because it shows the breadth
of Native Client.

489
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,730
As I alluded to earlier, games
are interesting, because they

490
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,530
really push the performance, and
then a whole lot of other

491
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,300
categories will come afterwards,
and this is a

492
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,740
great example of
that happening.

493
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,720
So our last presenter
is Oren Tversky.

494
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,960
He is the VP of Business
Development at Unity

495
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,060
Technologies.

496
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,260
And Unity, as you probably know,
is one of the biggest

497
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,140
game engines and editors, and
they have hundreds of

498
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,930
thousands of developers.

499
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,620
Please help me welcome
Oren Tversky.

500
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,220
[APPLAUSE]

501
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,180
OREN TVERSKY: So thank
you very much.

502
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,990
We're really happy
to be there.

503
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,190
And thanks to Neil
for the plug.

504
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,990
But Unity is not just used to
make solar panels, and I

505
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,910
apologize, I can't teach anybody
how to put together

506
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,550
any kind of panel.

507
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,740
As Christian mentioned, Unity
makes a tool chain and engine

508
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:25,580
that's used by 190,000
developers on a monthly basis.

509
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,420
We estimate that about 2,000
mobile games have been made

510
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,930
using Unity--

511
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,390
lots of games also
on console on PC.

512
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,770
And we also have our own web
plug-in, and this web plug-in

513
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,860
has an installed base of
about 90 million, and

514
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,450
this is pretty good.

515
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,890
And those of you who follow
gaming trends certainly know

516
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,650
that in-browser gaming is
an up and coming trend.

517
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,090
We've all seen the social games
and all that, but that's

518
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,960
extending now far and wide.

519
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,420
So this is really where kind of
a partnership with Google

520
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,750
around Native Client made
a lot of sense.

521
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,150
And we actually think this is
going to benefit developers

522
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,000
and consumers alike.

523
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,030
If we can roll the first video,
that would be great.

524
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,530
So this is actually the
Unity tool chain.

525
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,900
So this is what it actually
looks like when

526
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,730
you're making a game.

527
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,420
And as you can see, there is a
little check box that says

528
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,570
enable Native Client, and
then you push Go.

529
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,080
So our goal in working with
Google, and our goal to make

530
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
our lives easier for developers,
is really kind of

531
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,040
that simple.

532
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,980
Let's make it that easy.

533
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,990
The other way we think it'll
benefit developers is through

534
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,490
distribution and monetization.

535
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,430
And we're always looking for
ways to help our developers

536
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,070
reach new audiences and monetize
their games better.

537
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,780
Because after all, everybody's
got to make a living, right?

538
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,180
So our web plug-in has an
installed base of about 90

539
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,950
million, but we're really happy
to be able to add the

540
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:05,140
200 million and growing Chrome
users worldwide to that

541
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,700
distribution channel.

542
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,920
And we also think having a
monetization channel through

543
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,180
the Chrome web store
will help our

544
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,150
developers earn a nice living.

545
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,500
But we think the benefits will
also extend to consumers.

546
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,250
We think that having that
frictionless gaming

547
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,960
experience--

548
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,100
and if you can roll video
number two, please.

549
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,360
So this is a game by a company
called SilverTree Media based

550
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,380
in Palo Alto, and this
game is called Cordy.

551
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,540
And you can see how easy
it is to launch.

552
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,710
No plug-in, no dialogues,
frictionless.

553
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,320
We think this will make the
consumers much more likely to

554
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,640
play games and to spend
money in games.

555
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,710
The other way we think the
consumers will benefit is from

556
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,960
the native level performance.

557
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,910
And this is where we've done a
lot of work with Google to

558
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,440
make sure that we hit native
quality performance, so you

559
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,650
can really have a
beautiful gaming

560
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,540
experience out of the box.

561
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,220
And finally, we think consumers
will benefit because

562
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,470
there's just going to be a lot
of great games out there.

563
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,710
So we've got over 2,000 games
on mobile, we'd love to see

564
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,425
them all come to Native
Client, and

565
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,590
we think they will.

566
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,370
So why are we--

567
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,210
you can finish the video--

568
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,400
why are we here today?

569
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,000
Today we're announcing the
deployment of five Unity

570
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,230
Native Client games to
the Chrome web store.

571
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,900
And they are two by
SilverTree Media--

572
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,780
Cordy, which we showed
you, and Sleepy Jack.

573
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,520
Two by Exit Strategy,
Pirates of New

574
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,690
Horizons and Planet Buster.

575
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,540
And finally, one by a company
called Dedalord.

576
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,320
The game is called
Running Fred.

577
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,420
So my colleague Randy will be
over in that pod over there,

578
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,740
demoing all the games.

579
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,330
Really, our message to
developers is you should check

580
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,750
that Native Client box.

581
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,860
And to the rest of you, enjoy
the games, and I just want to

582
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,540
really thank Google for the
opportunity to be here.

583
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:08,222
[APPLAUSE]

584
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:11,350
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: Right, so
these examples really show how

585
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,940
Native Client can push the
boundaries of what's possible

586
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,370
on the web.

587
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,930
And on that note, we're really
excited to see several other

588
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,210
middleware being ported
to Native Client.

589
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,940
These include Unity, of course,
as you've just heard.

590
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,480
It includes Bullet, the physics
engine; Moai, another

591
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,880
game engine; FMOD and Wwise,
audio engines; and Mono which

592
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,900
enables you to write your app
in the entire dot net family

593
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,930
of languages.

594
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,500
And this is really exciting,
because it means the Native

595
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,080
Client platform is much more
accessible to the hundreds of

596
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,110
thousands of developers who
are already using these

597
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,360
middleware products.

598
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,760

599
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,280
So then the question is, well,
what's next for Native Client?

600
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,290
And I've got it right here.

601
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,370
We are adding features.

602
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,420
We'll be adding more APIs for
networking, in particular for

603
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,590
web sockets.

604
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,910
We're scoping out APIs
for game pads.

605
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,320
I'm sure a lot of people
in the audience will be

606
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,130
interested in that.

607
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,880
And we're adding more
features, like

608
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,830
memory mapped files.

609
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,010
This means that when you're
reading or writing large

610
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,470
files, you can get a performance
increase of orders

611
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,820
of magnitude, really.

612
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,970
What's more important is to
notice that these interfaces,

613
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,510
the Pepper APIs, are going to
continue to evolve in tandem

614
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,390
with the web platform.

615
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,310
And what that means is whenever
a new capability is

616
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,420
added to the browser, you would
expect to see JavaScript

617
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,180
APIs for that capability, and
Pepper APIs for the same

618
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,540
capability being added at
roughly the same time.

619
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,440
And whenever that does happen,
we're going to make sure to

620
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,710
have an SDK ready with the
header files, and all you

621
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,660
need, in the hands of developers
at the time where

622
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,410
that version of Chrome
is in beta channel.

623
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,860
So you'll have time to develop
apps that take advantage of

624
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,590
these features before it's
shipped into stable channel.

625
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,570

626
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,030
Another key thing for Native
Client has always been

627
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,840
portability.

628
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,870
And the portability benefits
of the system today are

629
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,770
already pretty compelling,
but there's more work.

630
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,020
In order really to be as
portable as JavaScript, we

631
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,910
need to eliminate any barriers
to the introduction of new

632
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,440
instruction sets or new
operating systems.

633
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,910
And to that end, David
Sehr who's in the

634
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,050
audience here today--

635
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,800
David, do you want to--

636
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,770
David Sehr is leading
an effort called

637
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,950
Portable Native Client.

638
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,930
And Portable Native Client will
introduce an instruction

639
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,850
set mutual wire format to
Native Client, while

640
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,430
maintaining the performance and
the security benefits that

641
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,290
we've already established
for the system.

642
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,330
And this is really important,
because this means that Native

643
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,520
Client is going to run, not
just on today's operating

644
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,610
systems, and today's instruction
set architectures,

645
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,760
but on the future operating
systems, and future

646
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,280
instruction set architectures.

647
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,180
So with that, I'd like to invite
Ian back on stage for a

648
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,620
couple of closing remarks.

649
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,870
Ian.

650
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,968

651
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:14,470
IAN ELLISON TAYLOR:
So hopefully--

652
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,650
there's obviously a lot we could
cover, and in the time

653
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,490
available we can only give you
a brief taste of what's

654
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,520
possible in Native Client.

655
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,420
But hopefully we've given you
at least a good sense of how

656
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,290
we've achieved on some of those
original points that I

657
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,580
mentioned way back
in the beginning.

658
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,980
How we can really push the
boundary in terms of the kinds

659
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,560
of applications that you can
run on the web by bringing

660
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,110
native-like performance.

661
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,450
But also maintaining the
portability and the

662
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,160
scalability, and the reach,
and the deployment

663
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,380
benefits of the web.

664
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,670
So taking those things together,
and these amazing

665
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,870
demos, and many others that we
couldn't show, hopefully that

666
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,250
all comes together into a
pretty compelling story.

667
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,330
So we at Google, of course,
are very excited about the

668
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,660
possibilities and what
we've seen so far.

669
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,560
More to the point, hopefully you
are getting excited about

670
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,470
what you could maybe come
up with that you

671
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,190
haven't seen today.

672
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,620
So I very much look forward to
seeing what kinds of amazing

673
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,910
experiences you come up with in
the weeks and months ahead,

674
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:24,230
as we continue to drive
the platform forward.

675
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,040
We're going to do some Q&A at
the back in about 10 seconds,

676
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,120
and hopefully, I think,
get to the beer.

677
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,620
So do stick around, ask me
questions, ask us questions,

678
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,530
ask our partners questions.

679
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:40,600
We've obviously got a lot more
we could be working on, and

680
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,370
your feedback will really help
us set the future direction

681
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,820
for Native Client.

682
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,580
With that, I'd like to thank--

683
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,370
wave at our audience in Asia--

684
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,370
I'm waving at the camera, I
actually have no idea where

685
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,730
the camera is so I'm just
waving vaguely.

686
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:59,550
I hope they had a good
video conference.

687
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,660
And, of course, thank you for
coming to Mountain View to

688
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,510
share in this launch.

689
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,420
Thank you very much.

690
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,847
[APPLAUSE]
