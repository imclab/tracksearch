Peter Vesterbecka: Yeah, so we
just released our first version

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:09,292
for the biggest platform out there.

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,750
So, we released Angry Birds for the web
together with the Chrome team.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,375
So, that's actually now available
in the Chrome Web Store.

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:20,917
So we built this using like
some of the latest HTML features,

7
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,000
so this is all WebGL.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,958
Okay. We also support Canvas for people
that don't have WebGL in their browser.

9
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,917
We used the Google Web Toolkit,
so we built this all in Java.

10
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:35,375
Then we're using a bunch of
other stuff like the App cache.

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,208
So again being in the Chrome Web Store, 

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,083
we have access to a bit more storage

13
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:44,875
so we can actually support the complete
Angry Birds game experience

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,542
when you're offline as well.

15
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:49,917
So, there's a lot of cool stuff
that went into this.

16
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:54,458
Yeah, so we brought this whole
Chrome dimension.

17
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:58,167
So it's a set of exclusive levels
that are only available in Chrome.

18
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,417
So that's something that
you should definitely check out.

19
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:05,542
There are seven levels in the Chrome
dimension and they're all very Chrome-y.

20
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:11,542
