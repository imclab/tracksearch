00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,133
I'm Matt Papakipos.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,901
I run the HTML 5
Open Web platform efforts

3
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:09,734
for Chrome at Google.

4
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:12,234
I'll be teaching a session
at Google I/O

5
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,901
about the Open Web platform
in Chrome.

6
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:18,400
This is the set of APIs
that Web developers can use

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,400
to implement applications
that do cool stuff.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,934
Our aspiration is to make it

9
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,400
so that anything you can build
as a desktop application,

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,234
you can build
as a Web application, right?

11
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,234
We want Web apps
that are as cool and as capable

12
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:33,400
as anything you can build
on your computer.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,234
So the sets of things
that we're working on

14
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:38,734
to make that happen
are video APIs,

15
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:42,067
2-D and 3-D graphics APIs,

16
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:46,834
native code execution
systems, um...

17
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,734
systems for doing
background JavaScript threads,

18
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,934
systems for doing
offline applications

19
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:55,067
that store on the local disk
and sync back to a server.

20
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,067
These are apps
that are starting to look

21
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,400
like traditional
native applications,

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,834
have all the same capabilities

23
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,734
and the same performance
and reliability characteristics,

24
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:05,067
but they run in your browser,

25
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,067
and they have all
the cool properties of Web apps.

26
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:11,400
You can use them
on whatever computer you're on.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,067
You don't have to install them.

28
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,567
You have extra
security guarantees.

29
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,400
This is why we're trying
to bring the power of the Web

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,067
to the applications
you use every day.

31
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,834
In the session, we'll talk
about what the APIs are,

32
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,100
what the road map is

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,234
for when we're releasing
all of this in Chrome,

34
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,968
and where we're going
in the future.

35
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:30,934
Hope to see you there.
