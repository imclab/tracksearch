1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,190
PAUL KINLAN: Hi.

3
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,180
I'm Paul Kinlan.

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,780
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

5
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,780
I work on Chrome, and
I've briefly worked

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,900
on the Web Lab project.

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,930
I'm here with two of the
engineers behind Web Lab, as

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,220
well, Roger and Mattias.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,860
Do you want to give yourself a
little bit of an introduction?

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,710
ROGER PALA: I'm Roger.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,260
I'm a creative technologist at
B-Reel, and I've been the

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,410
technical lead of the project.

13
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,680
MATTIAS EKENDAHL:
And I'm Mattias.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,875
I am also a technical
creative.

15
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,300
Do you say that?

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,710
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,420
[LAUGHTER]

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,150
PAUL KINLAN: It's either a
creative technical or a

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,770
technical creative.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,740
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: I don't
know the difference.

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,320
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE]

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,540
I'm an instrument technician not
a-- oh it doesn't matter.

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,716
I'm a technical supervisor not
a supervising technician.

24
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:13,412
Instrument technician,
that was my dad.

25
00:01:13,412 --> 00:01:15,260
That's my dad's job.

26
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,350
Anyway, sorry.

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,010
So we're here to talk about the
Web Lab project Web Lab is

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,550
a series of five real-world
Chrome experiments inside the

29
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,450
British Science Museum
in London.

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,280
And over the series of a couple
of Hangouts, we've

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,770
basically been introducing
each of the experiments.

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,670
So today's is the Teleporter
experiment.

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,590
And the Teleporter
is really cool.

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,660
It's basically three
Teleporters, three periscopes

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,260
inside the museum, essentially,
which you can

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,390
move along or move
around and be

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,500
transported across the world.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,560
I think we've got one in a shark
tank in South Africa.

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,390
So we've got a camera, a
360-degree camera, inside the

40
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,700
shark tank.

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,390
One in a miniature world in--

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,615
where is it?

43
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:57,660
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Hamburg.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,060
PAUL KINLAN: In Hamburg.

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,030
And then one in the bakery just

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,790
outside New York, I think.

47
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,620
Isn't it?

48
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,060
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,170
A 24-hour bakery.

50
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,170
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
a 24-hour bakery.

51
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,120
It's pretty cool.

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,840
The really cool thing I like
about this experiment--

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,775
obviously, it's very physical,
even though everything about

54
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,350
it is digital--

55
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,405
but when you get online you
still get this very similar

56
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,160
type of experience.

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,760
So just some of this--

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,460
I took my son to the British
Science Museum and we went on

59
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,635
[? the site to ?] play
with it, took

60
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:24,960
photos of where we were.

61
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,730
I mean, he had no idea where
the places were, but he was

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,410
like, this is so cool.

63
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,790
It's like they're working
in the bakery.

64
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,640
I said, yeah, they've
woken up.

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,490
It was 6 o'clock in the morning,
and it's guys in the

66
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,910
bakery just pounding dough
and everything.

67
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,610
It was pretty crazy.

68
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,790
But anyway, let's jump
into the experiment.

69
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,950
So this is the main screen
giving you an introduction

70
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,740
about what it looks like
inside the museum.

71
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,180
So these are the periscopes,
at least.

72
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,230

73
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,010
I have a little theme.

74
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,970
For every single Hangout
that we've done--

75
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,190
I told you about the loading
screens-- and this

76
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,220
was Flash as well.

77
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,470
Was it originally Flash
convergences?

78
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,330
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: To a Swiffy.

79
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,160
PAUL KINLAN: To a Swiffy.

80
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,120
So it's all in HTML5
in JavaScript, but

81
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,460
via the Flash process.

82
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,870
I get that in every time.

83
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,040
It's something I learned just
from this past week.

84
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,330
It's pretty crazy.

85
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,360
So this is the actual Teleporter
project on the

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,640
website, which gives you pretty
much the exact same

87
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,065
experience that you get
at the museum, right?

88
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:16,500
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,720
PAUL KINLAN: So we have
the three cameras.

90
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,060
We have this one here on the
left, which is the deli.

91
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,850
Hover over it.

92
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,860
That's a pretty cool transition,
wasn't it?

93
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,110
This is the miniature world in
Hamburg, and then this is the

94
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,660
rather dark, nighttime
aquatic museum in

95
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,960
South Africa, at least.

96
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,515
I think we'll just go with the
bakery one for most of this

97
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,110
with this Hangout.

98
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,821
It's got a lot of
stuff happening.

99
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,580
Oh, that was really cool.

100
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,600
Did you see that drop
off the screen then?

101
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,230
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

102
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,613
This is just from other people,
they are taking.

103
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:47,190
PAUL KINLAN: Sorry, that's
the first time

104
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,530
I've ever seen that.

105
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,030
So basically what happens with
the Teleporter is that you can

106
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,340
take snapshots at the museum
or online as well, right?

107
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,750
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

108
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,570
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

109
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,430
PAUL KINLAN: And they get
recorded to your lab tag, so

110
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,440
when you go home you can get
them back and see what you

111
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,550
recorded and print it out.

112
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,840
So should we just jump on this
and have a brief technical

113
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,610
deep dive into what people are
seeing right now, and why

114
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,280
we've got donuts.

115
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,262
I mean, are these real donuts?

116
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:15,626
No, they're not real donuts,
but it's kind of crazy.

117
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:19,565
Should we start a different
way instead?

118
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:22,120
How can I say this?

119
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,980
There can be 10,000 people,
20,000 people at any one time

120
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,180
controlling these
cameras, right?

121
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,030
So should we jump into one?

122
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,530
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

123
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:28,900
PAUL KINLAN: Because
I want to show the

124
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,710
people what's happening.

125
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,220
So this is the actual museum.

126
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,836
This is the bakery just
outside New York.

127
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:38,420
Is it Amelie's Bakery?

128
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,970
ROGER PALA: Right.

129
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,940
PAUL KINLAN: That's cool.

130
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,290
And as we can see the camera
is moving around.

131
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,250
This is not the actual
camera moving is it?

132
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:45,890
ROGER PALA: No.

133
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,260
So we have a 360 camera on site,
and then it sends the

134
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:58,350
whole 360 panoramic view through
a WebM Live Streaming.

135
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,720
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, it's
a WebM Live Stream.

136
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,560
ROGER PALA: Yeah, so we don't
use any plug-in for this

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,380
experiment.

138
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,580
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

139
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,386
So this is just literally the
video tag mapped on to--

140
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,310
I'm presuming this
is WebGL, is it?

141
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,085
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

142
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:13,950
So we receive this video
in the web of

143
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,700
an HTML video, basically.

144
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,550
It's like an infinite
HTML video.

145
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,200
And then we get this
data and we--

146
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,520
with a WebGL shader--

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,930
we transform it, and so--

148
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,045
PAUL KINLAN: So when you say
transform it, do you map it on

149
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,280
to the inside of a sphere
or something?

150
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,780
ROGER PALA: It's not actually a
sphere, it's just a fragment

151
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,810
shader that repositions each
of the pixels as--

152
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,975
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so it's
manipulating where the pixels

153
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:40,160
are to make it look like
it's kind of--

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,310
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

155
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,280
PAUL KINLAN: --or re-combine
this at [INAUDIBLE].

156
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,320
ROGER PALA: To get the
experience of the sphere.

157
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,800
PAUL KINLAN: That's
interesting.

158
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,320
I always thought you mapped
on to one texture.

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,290
You put on to the inside of a
sphere, then you move the

160
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:50,840
sphere around.

161
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,670
But it's even a little more
method than that.

162
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,790
You use a fragment shader.

163
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,170
See I was talking to
Paul Lewis the

164
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,270
other week about this.

165
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,460
I was calling them vertex--

166
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,820
I swear they were called
Vertex Shaders.

167
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,130
Maybe it's DirectX
or something.

168
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,140
And he's like, no, Paul, they're
fragment shaders.

169
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,170
He's like, huh.

170
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,410
That's how much I know
about know about web

171
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,860
[? geologists,?] generally.

172
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,240
So this is scrolling around, but
we do get the ability to

173
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,630
move around ourselves.

174
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,090
So we're not like a normal
webcam from the 1990s where

175
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,360
you would wait in the queue
for a minute and a half to

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,050
pass off, and then two seconds
later it would move up.

177
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,540
And you get complete control
of the webcam because it's

178
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,450
entirely virtual, right?

179
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,990
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

180
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,040
PAUL KINLAN: The projection
onside the

181
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,550
screen is entirely virtual.

182
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,715
It's a 360-degree camera.

183
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:34,080
That's pretty cool.

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,110
So I wonder what they're
making now?

185
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,220
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Brownies
or something.

186
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,180
They really look good.

187
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,952
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, they
look really nice.

188
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:42,305
So if we wanted to, we could
take a snapshot, right?

189
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:42,640
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

190
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,205
PAUL KINLAN: Press the
space bar, it will

191
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,680
take a snapshot itself.

192
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,540
That's pretty cool.

193
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,960
So this kind of compass in the
background, I mean, is that

194
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,980
WebGL as well or--

195
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,930
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No,
that's actually SVG.

196
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,870
That's generated in real time,
so it's creating the tags as

197
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,650
you turn around.

198
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,710
PAUL KINLAN: Oh right, so it's
not even already pre-created.

199
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,850
It's like a big, long screen
that creates the individual

200
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,050
items and then positions
the text.

201
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,110
Oh wow, okay.

202
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,380
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's creating
all in real time.

203
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,280
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

204
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,375
And how did you get this-- is
this bend effect here-- is

205
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,360
this part of the actual
fragment shader or--

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,810
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No.

207
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,470
The shader does much, but
just that effect, we

208
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,240
used the CSS mask.

209
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,470
PAUL KINLAN: OK, so you're
clipping off a region around

210
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,860
to give it.

211
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,920
That's pretty nice
stuff, isn't it?

212
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,410
Cool.

213
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,910
And I have a silly question.

214
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,640
This is going to sound
stupid, so excuse me,

215
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,470
everyone, if it is.

216
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,610
This halo effect,
is that just--

217
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,525
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's an SVG
overlaying the whole thing.

218
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:48,190
PAUL KINLAN: All right.

219
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,156
So it's like you have
it in a pastie?

220
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:50,500
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

221
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,850
PAUL KINLAN: And then you go
to transparent or opaque?

222
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,580
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

223
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,540
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

224
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,610
We have someone looking
through the

225
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,406
window, and he's waving.

226
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:58,852
Hello.

227
00:07:58,852 --> 00:07:59,744
[LAUGHTER]

228
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:02,770
PAUL KINLAN: So this is how
we record these things.

229
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,690
It's pretty cool.

230
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,040
We go with the flow,
see how it goes.

231
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,210
So what were some of the
technical challenges that you

232
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,700
faced with this project?

233
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,410
ROGER PALA: So I would say that
the WebM Live Streaming

234
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,170
was quite challenging on the
back end, because, as far as

235
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,550
we know, it's the first time
that someone used this

236
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:21,860
technology.

237
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,600
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

238
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,896
I don't think we've ever made
any announcement or anything

239
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:30,298
that we actually are streaming
web and video over the--

240
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,593
we haven't.

241
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:32,520
[LAUGHTER]

242
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,760
PAUL KINLAN: It's
breaking news.

243
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,789
This might be cut out.

244
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,609
We don't know.

245
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:39,340
ROGER PALA: But obviously, like
with any new technology,

246
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,380
it's been quite challenging
to handle all the errors.

247
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,070
PAUL KINLAN: That's interesting
because, a lot of

248
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,180
the time that we've done
this, it's been a

249
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,930
YouTube Live Stream.

250
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,920
But I presume we couldn't
pipe the data--

251
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
the 360-degree camera data--

252
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,050
into YouTube.

253
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,895
ROGER PALA: No, it was not
possible to get the data live.

254
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:56,340
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

255
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,680
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

256
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,230
PAUL KINLAN: And I suppose the
interesting thing is--

257
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,158
actually, that is a really good
point-- is because that's

258
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,170
the benefit of the HTML video
stream is that you can,

259
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,730
literally, just put it into a
texture and map it, put it

260
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,580
through WebGL, which we--

261
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:08,750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

262
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,330
ROGER PALA: The performance
is much better.

263
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,555
If we were using Flash, we had
to send this data from Flash

264
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,310
to JavaScript, which was slowing
down a lot of the

265
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,770
whole process.

266
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,463
PAUL KINLAN: Wasn't there a very
early prototype where it

267
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:21,340
was a Flash-based?

268
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,255
ROGER PALA: Yeah, at the
beginning we were using Flash

269
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:26,640
and sending the image
data to the canvas.

270
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,470
PAUL KINLAN: I'm really glad
that you guys got this to

271
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,390
work, actually, because
it is beautiful.

272
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,430
The thing I like about this
project is you don't know

273
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,030
about any of the technology it
uses behind the scenes, right?

274
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,220
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Right.

275
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,240
PAUL KINLAN: You don't know it's
using WebGL, and SVG, and

276
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,455
Canvas, and all that type
of stuff to get this.

277
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:40,940
It just looks pretty cool.

278
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,730
I actually remember my son got
a picture of a shark swimming

279
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,963
past the front.

280
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:46,380
He thought it was brilliant.

281
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,800
He thought it was amazing.

282
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,160
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And we have
seen people in the Miniatur

283
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,080
Wunderland getting engineers
coming up repairing stuff.

284
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,550
PAUL KINLAN: Really?

285
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,853
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Kind of
reaching for the camera.

286
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:56,895
[LAUGHING]

287
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:59,590
PAUL KINLAN: Oh man,
that's pretty cool.

288
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,880
These are really cool,
these ones.

289
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,012
So just to jump onto this--

290
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:09,700
well, we have no screen,
so let me refresh.

291
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,270
Oh, it was loading.

292
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,610
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

293
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,790
PAUL KINLAN: Did you see that?

294
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,060
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

295
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,685
PAUL KINLAN: It did say it was
loading just as I refreshed.

296
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:17,250
I love these things.

297
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,090
Actually, so we're gonna talk
about the Universal

298
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,480
Orchestra later on.

299
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
I love some of the animations
that you did in that one.

300
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,740
So if you get a chance to watch
the Universal Orchestra

301
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,770
Hangout, I would because
it's got some really

302
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,020
cool stuff in there.

303
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,500

304
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,304
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And we seem
to have lost the internet.

305
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:36,210
PAUL KINLAN: No we haven't.

306
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,960
See, it's when you say we have
lost it, we get it back.

307
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,860
So this is a really
cool thing.

308
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,570
So I mean, you mentioned
something about canvas--

309
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,800
normal 2D canvas.

310
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,050
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes, so here
we have both the WebGL showing

311
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,940
the donut and which is actually
just one shader that

312
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,740
then transforms it into the
spherical view of it as well.

313
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,080
So that's one shader, and then
around it we have a 2D canvas

314
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,060
that shows the clock.

315
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,640
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so this clock
over on the outside here--

316
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,090
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

317
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,540
ROGER PALA: It is the timer.

318
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,190
PAUL KINLAN: This
is the timer.

319
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,080
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

320
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,300
PAUL KINLAN: It's a pretty
nice layout.

321
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,790
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And when you
roll over it, it's JavaScript

322
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:20,200
moving divs and stuff to
get that animation.

323
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,786
PAUL KINLAN: That's really
cool, isn't it?

324
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:25,470
You know, I still-- and I
said this earlier on--

325
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,270
I never saw the photos just
drop off last time.

326
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,110
Is that a relatively new thing,
or has that been there?

327
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,490
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's
been there-- been

328
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,100
there from the start.

329
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,290
PAUL KINLAN: Seriously?

330
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,670
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

331
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:34,960
PAUL KINLAN: All right.

332
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,590
Can I click on them?

333
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,440
ROGER PALA: No.

334
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,130
PAUL KINLAN: Feature request.

335
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,360
[LAUGHING]

336
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,810
PAUL KINLAN: So that's
pretty cool, man.

337
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,280
Of course the live stream.

338
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,520
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And this is
from the museum, which is

339
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,510
closed at the moment.

340
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,730
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

341
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,460
We probably have to get special
dispensation to get

342
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,830
people through this.

343
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,490
But this is at the
museum, right?

344
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,410
So these are the-- like you
can see on the right-- the

345
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,530
orange Teleporter and
the blue one there.

346
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,520
It's exactly the same type of
experience, right, where you

347
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,970
can take a photo, save it to
your laptop, and then get it

348
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,260
back later.

349
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,695
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

350
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:06,130
ROGER PALA: Yep.

351
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,580
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty nice.

352
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,620
Yeah, so that was a nice little
deep dive into some of

353
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,020
the bits behind the Teleporter
project.

354
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,980
It's one of my favorite ones.

355
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,660
It's probably one of the most
interactive ones there, like

356
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,590
the physically interactive ones
at the museum itself.

357
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,350
If you get a chance, go and
check it out in the museum.

358
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,610
If not, check it out online.

359
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,460
It's just as good of a--

360
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,730
I can't speak.

361
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,472
It's an awesome experience.

362
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:30,722
Cool, thank you.

363
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:37,467
