00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:15,760

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,790
TV RAMAN: Welcome to our
hangout on Chrome

3
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,990
accessibility.

4
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,160
We are talking to you today
about the work we're doing on

5
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,750
the Chrome, Chrome OS
platform for blind

6
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,900
and low-vision users.

7
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,550
With me I have James
DeBoer on my

8
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,450
engineering team on my right.

9
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,040
And next to him, we
have Charles Chen.

10
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,095
And under of the table, watching
the doggy cam, we

11
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,360
have Tilden Labrador.

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,260
So brief over of what we'll
talk about today--

13
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,650
Chrome OS is this really nice
environment that runs on

14
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,190
Chromebooks and Chromeboxes.

15
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,130
That's a lightweight, desktop,
laptop environment.

16
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,100
You open your laptop, within
five seconds you're on the

17
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,230
network and reading email
and doing what you

18
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,560
normally do on the web.

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,940
What we wanted to do was to
bring that same level of

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,790
simplicity and efficiency
of access to blind

21
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,380
and low-vision users.

22
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,640
And the result of that work is
this tool that the ChromeVox,

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,230
which is a Chrome extension that
runs on pretty much every

24
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,110
platform that Chrome runs, all
the way from Linux, Mac,

25
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,570
Windows, Chrome OS, and
Android, actually.

26
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,880
For today, we will be focusing
on Chrome OS and show you how

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,170
end user access works.

28
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,070
So what we're talking about
here is primarily spoken

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,350
output for the bilnd user.

30
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,290
The blind user is perfectly
capable of using a keyboard,

31
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,980
touch type.

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,990
Chromebook keyboards are just
regular QWERTY keyboards, so

33
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,530
we don't have to do anything
special there.

34
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,100
We actually have ChromeVox
built into

35
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,040
every Chrome OS device.

36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,780
It comes with an extra speech
voice that is fairly

37
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,140
understandable but not
very high quality.

38
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,590
And then users can actually
get a higher-quality voice

39
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,800
from the Chrome Web Store.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,090
So for most of this demo,
you'll actually hear the

41
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,160
higher quality voice.

42
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,560
High level overview
of the sequence of

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,060
things we'll show you--

44
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,050
Charles will start off by
showing you how you can pick

45
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,350
up a generic Chromebook, hit a
single key, and, as a blind

46
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,390
user, start using it, including
setting it up,

47
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,070
logging in, setting up the
network, all that good stuff.

48
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,510
And as he's doing that,
initially you will hear the

49
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,510
built-in lower quality voice.

50
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,390
But then once he's signed in,
you'll notice that the quality

51
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,090
of text to speech drastically
improves.

52
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,050
So Charles, once he has that
set up, will do a couple of

53
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,990
web searches, show you how you
can listen to web content

54
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,360
using ChromeVox, and then hand
it over to James, who will

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,750
show you know how web apps
work in this way.

56
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,970
I mean today, things like Chrome
OS are motivated by the

57
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,760
fact that the web is more than
just static documents.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,630
It's a web of applications.

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,000
Chrome OS, basically, all the

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,180
applications live in the cloud.

61
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,350
And that's what James will show
you with Google Docs.

62
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,310
After that, what we'll
do is more into some

63
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,530
developer-focused bits.

64
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,660
So what we really want to show
the web community here is how

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,340
end users work with this
technology, but then how you,

66
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,720
as web developers, can leverage
this technology to

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,920
make sure that what you're
building is accessible.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,240
Accessibility has always been
a challenge because it has

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,220
traditionally been fairly
complex to test and verify

70
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,570
accessibility.

71
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,650
And one of the things that we
believe is that by making that

72
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,670
technology available to every
developer, we drastically

73
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,480
increase the chances of creating
web content and wep

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
apps that are accessible.

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,590
So Charles and James will
demo some of that,

76
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,480
including best practices.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,160
And then finally, James will
come back to something really

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,940
cool, which is we, as

79
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,160
engineers, developed ChromeVox.

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,540
And ChromeVox itself is a fairly
complex web extension

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,260
at this point.

82
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,820
And so we need to test ChromeVox
to make sure it is

83
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,140
doing the right thing.

84
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,530
And James will show you a test
harness that we've built

85
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,030
inside ChromeVox that lets
us do that as engineers.

86
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,960
And this is an open
source project.

87
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,510
We'll finally wrap up with a
quick tour of where the code

88
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,560
is so that you can learn and
leverage what we're building.

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,360
So with that, we'll go to the
first stage of this talk,

90
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
which is Charles showing you
out of box access on a

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,990
Chromebook.

92
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,120
And to repeat, there's nothing
special about that Chromebook

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,690
he's holding.

94
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,920
You could go to a local Best
Buy, or Amazon, or whatever

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,990
and buy a Chromebook, and you
will get exactly what he's

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,890
about to open and show you.

97
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,000
CHARLES CHEN: Thanks Raman.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,350
So let's go over to my
Chromebook here.

99
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,060
And I'm going to log in.

100
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,910
And first, you'll notice that
this is just, like Raman said,

101
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,300
this is a standard Chromebook,
nothing special about it.

102
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,200
It's not talking yet, so
let's get it talking.

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,450
It's a very simple command
sequence--

104
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,295
Control, Alt, and Z. You press
these keys together, and it

105
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:22,440
will start speaking.

106
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,980
So let's do that.

107
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,460
CHROMEBOOK: Enabling
spoken feedback.

108
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
CHARLES CHEN: OK, you just heard
it say, "enabling spoken

109
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,370
feedback." You also see that
there's now a focus rectangle

110
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,870
showing where it thinks
its focus is.

111
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,690
And so let's log in and
get on the web.

112
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,616
CHROMEBOOK: Dot, dot, dot,
dot, dot, dot, dot.

113
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,720
CHARLES CHEN: OK, and notice
how it just said "dot," so

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,230
it's not going to blare
out my password,

115
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,300
which is kind of nice.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,010
CHROMEBOOK: Signing in.

117
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,050
Connected to Google Guest.

118
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,580
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so it
told me I signed in.

119
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,070
I'm on Google Guest,
ready to roll.

120
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,060
So let's learn a little
bit more about Chrome.

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,430
I'm going to do a search for
Wikipedia on Chrome, and let's

122
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,680
see what we get.

123
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,290

124
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,522
OK.

125
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:07,620
CHROMEBOOK: (DIFFERENT, HIGHER
QUALITY VOICE) Wikipedia

126
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,150
Chrome Google search.

127
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,510
TV RAMAN: Now, notice that the
voice quality has gone up

128
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,180
drastically.

129
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,670
That's because he's now signed
in, and it's using the

130
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,745
higher-quality voice that
is there on the box.

131
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:19,860
CHARLES CHEN: OK.

132
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,880
And now I can show you I can do
some simple things, such as

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,150
tabbing around this page.

134
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,680
CHROMEBOOK: Main ordered

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,030

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,450

137
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,725
[? three. ?]

138
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:29,610
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so this
actually got me to the first

139
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,610
search result.

140
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,220
If I wanted to read around a
bit, I can do that as well.

141
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,420
All I have to do is hit the
ChromeVox modifier, shift and

142
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,470
search, and then use
the arrow keys.

143
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,664
CHROMEBOOK: Chrome, hyphen.

144
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:43,700
CHARLES CHEN: OK, If I want to
hear more than one shot, I can

145
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,190
change my granularity levels.

148
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,190
CHARLES CHEN: So this gives
me group reading mode.

149
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,860
So this lets me hear things in
one shot, in a very easy to

150
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,730
understand way.

151
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,364

CHARLES CHEN: You'll also
notice that, as the page

157
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,060
loads, it made a couple
of dings.

158
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,690
This is to let the user know
that the page is loaded up and

it's ready to go.

175
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,380
I can do that by using Go to
Next Heading, which is simply

176
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,215
ChromeVox modifier, N, and
then H, for next heading.

177
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,770
CHROMEBOOK: Contents,
heading two.

178
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,470
CHARLES CHEN: So it just jumped
me to the next heading.

179
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,112
I can do that again.

180
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:58,820
CHROMEBOOK: Left bracket,
heading two.

181
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,490
Left bracket, heading three.

182
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,820
Left bracket, heading three.

183
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,480
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so it's taking
me through a couple of

184
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,160
the brackets under different
heading.

185
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,816
I can resume reading.

186
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:07,475
CHROMEBOOK: Edit link.

187
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,400
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so
it's the edit link.

188
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,220
CHROMEBOOK: Right bracket,
public release.

189
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,257
CHARLES CHEN: OK, and I can keep
going from that point.

190
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:15,720
CHROMEBOOK: Link.

191
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,010
CHARLES CHEN: So that's
some of the basic

192
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,960
functionality of ChromeVox.

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,250
I'm going to go ahead and hand
it off to James, who

194
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,430
will show web apps.

195
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,840
James, take it away.

196
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,160
JAMES DEBOER: Thank you.

197
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,813
And I'm going to
set my volume.

198
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,080
And I have lost my microphone.

199
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,405
CHARLES CHEN: Do you
want to use mine?

200
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,630
JAMES DEBOER: That would
probably be easiest.

201
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,880
CHARLES CHEN: OK.

202
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,040

203
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,920
TV RAMAN: Yeah, while we get
set up, notice that you've

204
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,830
seen a web of documents
so far.

205
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,130
Very quickly, we are going to
the interactive, dynamic,

206
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,430
application-oriented web.

207
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,745
And Google Docs is probably the
web app that pushes the

208
00:09:56,745 --> 00:10:00,810
envelope the most with respect
to using the web platform to

209
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,790
build a rich specific editor.

210
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,191
And that's what James is
about to show you.

211
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,060
JAMES DEBOER: All right,
so I have my Google

212
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,750
Drive home page here.

213
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,920
And sorry, we're--

214
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,090
CHARLES CHEN: We're tangled.

215
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,550
JAMES DEBOER: We're
lost in the cords.

216
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,970

217
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,540
Let me turn on the volume
of my Chromebook.

218
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:36,230
And so, as you can see, with
the screen, I have spoken

219
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,240
feedback already enabled.

220
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,205
And I can move around the page
using the ChromeVox keys.

221
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,455
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

222
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:48,080

223
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,380
JAMES DEBOER: But Google Drive
also has a lot of keyboard

224
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:01,830
shortcuts that make it easy to
perform operations within

225
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,770
Google Drive.

226
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,638
So I'm going to use this
Shift-T shortcut.

227
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,056
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

228
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:10,480
D, O, C, S, untitled document,
Google Drive, new line.

229
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,580
JAMES DEBOER: And what
that's done, it's

230
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,000
opened a new document.

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,150
And the cursor, it's
ready to type.

232
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,640
So I can type--

233
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,112
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

234
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,862
Line, space.

235
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:30,846
[INAUDIBLE]

236
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:35,380
space G, O, O, G, L, E, space.

237
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,940
JAMES DEBOER: And so as I'm
typing, Google Docs is reading

238
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,060
back through ChromeVox.

239
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,520
And I can move around
my document.

240
00:11:50,520 --> 00:12:00,900
Now here, Google Docs is using
the ChromeVox API to help

241
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,110
speak because it's a very
complicated web app.

242
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:16,350
And it's talking directly to
ChromeVox to say, when you

243
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,710
press the arrow key, speak
the letter underneath it.

244
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,270
But the ChromeVox navigation
is still available.

245
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,850
So if I used the ChromeVox keys,
such as the up key--

246
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,790
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE]

247
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,710
selected.

248
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,376
Enable screen reader.

249
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,095
An ordered with one item's
list item, [INAUDIBLE]

250
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:44,160
untitled document, menu bar,
file, menu [INAUDIBLE].

251
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,660
JAMES DEBOER: And using the
ChromeVox keys, I can still

252
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,260
move around the page.

253
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:57,700
And then a number of widgets in
Google Docs are using their

254
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,770
own keyboard navigation.

255
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,710
So I can just use the arrow
keys, not the ChromeVox keys,

256
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,686
to interact with the menus.

257
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,070
CHROMEBOOK: Edit collapse
as pop-up.

258
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,210
View collapse as pop-up.

259
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,050
Insert collapse as pop-up.

260
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,286
Insert expanded as pop-up.

261
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:18,735
Image.

262
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:22,400
Control+KL [INAUDIBLE].

263
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,585
Control, plus Alt, plus
M colon, control plus

264
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,790
alt plus F 6 of 15.

265
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,040
JAMES DEBOER: And so here I'm
moving through the menus.

266
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,510
And I can interact with them.

267
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,440
And this is something that
Google Docs has built.

268
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,860
But the ChromeVox navigation
and any other screen reader

269
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,330
navigation is still available.

270
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,620
TV RAMAN: So James staged
something interesting there,

271
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,015
which is the topic of a future
hangout that we're hoping to

272
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:56,480
do, which is he mentioned
the ChromeVox API.

273
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,150
And what that is is really of
relevance to web developers,

274
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,200
where if you're building a very
cutting-edge web app and

275
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,810
you would like to add, augment,
control how things

276
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,160
are spoken, the ChromeVox API
is actually what you use.

277
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,250
So normally, you code your web
app using standard HTML and

278
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,206
ARIA, which we'll quickly show
you in terms of how those

279
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:24,840
things work, do all of your
typical web best practices.

280
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,970
But then, if you finally want
to add a little bit of

281
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,010
additional accessibility source
for making your apps

282
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,530
really usable, then the
ChromeVox API, which we will

283
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,990
detail in a future hangout, is
basically what you would use.

284
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,940

285
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,390
JAMES DEBOER: All right, now I'd
like to show you something

286
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,910
interesting.

287
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:54,240
So ChromeVox is just a Chrome
extension written entirely in

288
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,200
JavaScript.

289
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,640
So we write all our tests and
we develop in JavaScript.

290
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,990
So here is some of our tests.

291
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,770
And this one that I'm going
to run it is our backward,

292
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,040
forward test.

293
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,730
And what it does is it
stimulates ChromeVox commands

294
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,120
for moving backwards and
forwards and tries to make it

295
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,460
all the way through
a web page.

296
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,720
And so this makes it really easy
for us to find bugs in

297
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,600
ChromeVox and then also to find
interesting web pages

298
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,140
that break our navigation
model.

299
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,540
And then hopefully
we can fix either

300
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,670
ChromeVox or the web page.

301
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,322
So let's see let's
see how it does.

302
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:45,572
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

303
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:50,480

304
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,410
JAMES DEBOER: OK, so I've
turned off the sound.

305
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,530
But you could hear ChromeVox
talking.

306
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,960
And it's running through the
entire web page-- this is the

307
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,260
Wikipedia home page--

308
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,150
And just going forward, and then
forward again, and back,

309
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,180
and making sure it ends
up in the same place.

310
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,990
And as you can see, it's gone
all the way through the

311
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,580
Wikipedia homepage and has
made it back to the top.

312
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,820
And so that's a pass.

313
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,090
And we run this test and other
tests like it on a number of

314
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,930
web pages just looking
for errors.

315
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,980
CHARLES CHEN: Well
thanks, James.

316
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,080
Now James said something
interesting about finding

317
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,730
errors in web pages.

318
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,350
We have automated tests like
these, which will help make

319
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,570
sure your page navigation
is sensible.

320
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,470
But it's also a good idea to
just run ChromeVox yourself

321
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,290
and see if it makes sense the
way that your web page is

322
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,380
going through and if you're
managing focus correctly.

323
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,510
I'm about show a demo here which
illustrates some of the

324
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,220
common pitfalls that web
developers can very easily

325
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,530
fall into as well as
how to fix them.

326
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,250
So one moment while we swap.

327
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,780
Raman, would you like say a
few words while we swap?

328
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,170
TV RAMAN: Right, so while
Charles is swapping out, we

329
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:17,069
are going to show you a very key
piece of functionality in

330
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,480
a web app that you need to
get right, which is focus

331
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,790
management.

332
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,020
Because, at the end of the day,
as you move focus in an

333
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,290
app, is what the user
is working on.

334
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,310
And that's what the user's
getting spoken feedback about.

335
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,810
So if you don't set focus
correctly, when the user, say,

336
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,980
performs a task that comes back,
it's like you're giving

337
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,210
your friend a ride but then,
instead of dropping him at the

338
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,950
front door of his house or
the front door of a large

339
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,150
building, dropping them off in
the middle of a parking lot

340
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,960
and saying go find your way.

341
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,060
So Charles will show you
this briefly today.

342
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,690
There's also a much more
detailed version of all of

343
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,700
these that we did as a talk at
Google I/O. If you just search

344
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,780
for accessibility in Google I/O
2012, you can watch that

345
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,900
talk on YouTube.

346
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,530
CHARLES CHEN: OK,
thanks Raman.

347
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,960
So I have a page here that's
an example page.

348
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,770
[CHROMEBOOK CHIMES]

349
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,480
CHARLES CHEN: OK, and I'm going
to navigate through it.

350
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,235
And I'm going to try and click
on the link. it will bring up

351
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:18,020
a pop-up, and let's see what
the behavior is like.

352
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,780
So let's get started.

353
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,330
CHROMEBOOK: Snack attack,
heading one.

354
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,960
Which snacks are best for
hacking all night long?

355
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,940
List with eight items, list
item, pizza delivery, link.

356
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,860
Object, list with eight
items, list item,

357
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,360
pizza delivery, link.

358
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,890
CHARLES CHEN: OK,
so far, so good.

359
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,170
I managed to navigate
to the first choice.

360
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,080
I really like pizza.

361
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,345
Let's try clicking this.

362
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:40,230

363
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,260
OK, so what just
happened here?

364
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,050
If I was relying solely on
speech, I would think nothing

365
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,820
happened because even though
there's a visual pop-up, you

366
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,020
don't hear anything.

367
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,140
So you really don't know
what's going on here.

368
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,100
But let's say I'm going to
take it on faith that

369
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,740
something happened.

370
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,490
Let's try reading.

371
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,080
Let's see what I hear next.

372
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,250
CHROMEBOOK: 7,965 ratings.

373
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,300
CHARLES CHEN: Wait, where
is that on the screen?

374
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,730
CHROMEBOOK: List item,
caffeinated soda, link.

375
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,720
CHARLES CHEN: Wait, that's
not even on the

376
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
screen anymore, is it?

377
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,760
So what happened here is there
was a pop-up that came out,

378
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,800
but like Raman said, this is
equivalent to taking your

379
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,580
friend somewhere and dropping
them in the middle of a street

380
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,370
and saying you're there instead
of helping them all

381
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,120
the way to where they
need to go.

382
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,760
A pop-up has happened, but it's
somewhere at the end of

383
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,220
the DOM, and the user hasn't had
their focus moved there.

384
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,640
So the user at this
point is kind of

385
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,240
struggling on this page.

386
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,400
They don't know where the pop-up
is, and as far as they

387
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,260
can tell, nothing has actually
happened, which leads to a

388
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,080
pretty frustrating and broken
user experience.

389
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,920
So let's see how we can
make this much better.

390
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,650

391
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,150
CHROMEBOOK: Google X, Chrome,
Googlecode.com

392
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,860
slash, E, O, N. [? Cafe ?]

393
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,670
Snack Attack.

394
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,760
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so this page
visually looks identical.

395
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,090
But let's see what happens when
you navigate through it.

396
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,280
CHROMEBOOK: Snack Attack,
heading one.

397
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,880
Which Snacks are best for
hacking all night long?

398
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,560
Object, which snack, list with
eight items, list item, pizza

399
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,405
delivery, button.

400
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,690
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so let's
do this again.

401
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,950
CHROMEBOOK: Entering dialog,
rating dialog, no ratings,

402
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,600
slider, no rating.

403
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,000
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so in this
case, the main difference is

404
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,530
that, in this example, we've
managed focus properly.

405
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,360
So when a pop-up shows up, we
then put focus on the thing

406
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,090
that makes the most sense,
which is the ratings bar.

407
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,830
And in that case, it triggers
ChromeVox or any other screen

408
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,870
reader into reading the fact
that the user has entered a

409
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,630
dialog as well as what they're
currently focused on, which is

410
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,140
the ratings bar.

411
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,730
And so with that, you can
now drive the ratings.

412
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,580
CHROMEBOOK: One star,
ew, gross.

413
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,910
Two stars, meh.

414
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,730
Three stars, OK, sure.

415
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,495
Four stars, awesome.

416
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:52,790
CHARLES CHEN: OK, I think
that's pretty awesome.

417
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,055
So, but let's see what
five stars does.

418
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:57,836
CHROMEBOOK: Five stars,
NOMNOMNOM.

419
00:20:57,836 --> 00:20:59,560
CHARLES CHEN: OK, I kind
of I like that.

420
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,110
So let's go, and let's
vote on this.

421
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,104
CHROMEBOOK: Vote, button.

422
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,400
CHARLES CHEN: OK, I'm
going to vote.

423
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,650
CHROMEBOOK: Saving.

424
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,335
CHARLES CHEN: And it even tells
me that it's saving.

425
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:06,610
CHROMEBOOK: Exiting dialog.

426
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,870
List with eight items, list
item, pizza delivery, button.

427
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,050
CHARLES CHEN: So that's a much
friendlier user experience,

428
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,440
and that really helps the user
know what they're doing.

429
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,170
So with that, Raman, do you
want to add anything?

430
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,700
TV RAMAN: Sure, yeah.

431
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,990
And so basically, for what
Charles showed you, we have

432
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,260
markup examples of this from
a Google I/O talk.

433
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,950
None of those is new source
that we're inventing.

434
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,230
This is all standard
HTML5 ARIA bits.

435
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,920
The focus management things are

436
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,090
really, really key, though.

437
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,730
Those are things that you need
to do in your JavaScript

438
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,420
handlers in terms of how you
handle pop-ups and how you

439
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,220
handle dialogs.

440
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,380
This is not something
that a standard

441
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,470
specification will tell you.

442
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,550
These are more implementation
techniques.

443
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,710
As we sort of wrap this up, as
I said at the top of this

444
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,950
talk, this is an open
source project.

445
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,460
Our goal is to open source this
for a couple of reasons.

446
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,930
One, Chrome itself is an open
source platform, and having

447
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,800
ChromeVox as an open source tool
really has zero impedance

448
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,220
mismatch with the project.

449
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,830
But more importantly, we'd like
to take the magic and

450
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,070
black art out of accessibility
and make it something that is

451
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,860
a well-understood,
easy-to-do bit.

452
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,210
Because when we do that, more of
you who are web developers

453
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,660
will implement accessibility,
and we all win.

454
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,080
And towards that end, I'd like
Charles and James to give you

455
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,500
a quick overview of where the
core ChromeVox code is.

456
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,720
All of our code on an open
source Google code project

457
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,340
called Google-axs-chrome.

458
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,745
Charles, do you just
want to give a--

459
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:44,340
CHARLES CHEN: Yeah, so I already
have the ChromeVox

460
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,980
Google code page up here.

461
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,525
So, as Raman mentioned, the URL
is simply Google-axs-chrom

462
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:49,775
e.Googlecode.com.

463
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,530

464
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,990
And all of our source code is
here, this includes ChromeVox

465
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,460
as well some of our other
projects, such as a low-vision

466
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,500
tool, our ChromeVis, and you can
also get our voice here,

467
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,370
our Lois TTS.

468
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,120
This also includes our Google
I/O talks, which include all

469
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,320
the examples that we
just went through.

470
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,300
And if you're interested in
contributing, there's the

471
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,070
source link right up here.

472
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,540
And that will tell you how you
can check out the code.

473
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,830
And patches are very welcome
and appreciated.

474
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,010
TV RAMAN: So for platforms
where ChromeVox isn't

475
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,150
pre-built in, so you're a Linux
developer and you're

476
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,640
developing your web app on
Linux, or a Macbook, or a

477
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,550
Windows box, or whatever,
you will need to install

478
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,170
ChromeVox, the extension, from
the Chrome web store.

479
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,730
And Lois, which Charles
mentioned, is the low end

480
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,760
voice that I talked about
at the beginning.

481
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,220
And if you search in the Chrome
Web Store for Google

482
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,530
TTS, you also see our higher
quality voice.

483
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,720
It's a bigger download, the
higher quality voice,

484
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,490
obviously, because it's
higher quantity.

485
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,140
And then you get a much
better sounding voice.

486
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,830
Play with that, send us email.

487
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,590
The project page tells us
how you can find us.

488
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,340
There's a Google group
for this work.

489
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,720
Above all, test your code
with ChromeVox, test the

490
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,940
experience.

491
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,060
And it'll make a difference both
to your site and to the

492
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,130
users who come to your site.

493
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,300
Thank you.

494
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,550
CHARLES CHEN: Thanks.

495
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:15,850
