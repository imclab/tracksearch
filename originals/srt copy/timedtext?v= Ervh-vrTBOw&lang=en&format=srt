00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420

00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,110
BILL LUAN: Shanghai GDG a very

3
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,200
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,960
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,320
has asked this question.

6
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,415
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:08,730
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

8
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,440
answer show, so if any
of you out there

9
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,700
would like to ask questions.

10
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,260

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,440
IDO GREEN: Today in this GDL
episode, we speak a little bit

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,810
about the new Chromebook.

13
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,180
And then I would love to dive
more into new things that any

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,980
web developer should know about
Chrome Dev Tools and how

15
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,020
they could leverage them and be
more productive when they

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,130
are building their next web
app or mobile web app.

17
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,945
So without further ado, let's
start and try to go--

18
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:48,530
I have this short list of things
that we could go and

19
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,780
work on it together.

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,490

21
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,650
And here are the main ones.

22
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,620
Of course, as you can see,
it's a blog post that I'm

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,270
going to publish later today.

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,150
But for now, let's just
go and dive into it.

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,880
So the first thing that we have
today in Chrome-- and

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,330
basically, before we even start,
I would love to offer

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,590
web developers the opportunity
to install Chrome Canary

28
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,510
alongside their regular,
stable Chrome.

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,380
You could go and just Google
Chrome Canary, install it.

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,620
And when you're working on
your development, I would

31
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,590
extremely encourage
you to use it.

32
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,980
It will give you great
capabilities in terms of

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,620
having the greatest and latest
features in the Dev Tools.

34
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,320
And moreover, you could see how
Chrome is going to look

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,130
like in the next
6 or 12 weeks.

36
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,510
So the first thing that
we have today--

37
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,110
let's open Chrome
Dev Tools here--

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,720
is the opportunity to have
a device emulation.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,670
So it's true that in the past
we had this opportunity with

40
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,140
other simulators that we
needed to install.

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,990
For instance, the iPhone
simulator on Mac or on any

42
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,400
iOS, and then for Android with
the simulators that work on

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,385
Windows, Mac, and
others platform.

44
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,330
But here, you have it
inside the browser.

45
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,680
So how you do that
is you saw--

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,930
or you didn't, but I'll
make it a bit bigger

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,610
so it will be easier.

48
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,860
I opened the Chrome Dev Tools.

49
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,930
Let me do this a big
bigger as well.

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,440
OK, so I'm going here to this
button, clicking on it.

51
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,980
And now when I have the Setting
opportunity, what I

52
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,100
can do here is basically
override the functionalities.

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,480
The main functionality
that I could

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,550
override is the user agent.

55
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,140
And that just allows me pretty
easily to mimic any mobile

56
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,250
device that I wish to do
or different browser.

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,650
It's very, very convenient and
efficient to see how your site

58
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,650
or web app will look on, let's
say, Android 2.3 or

59
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,200
BlackBerry, and so on.

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,330
So that's the first thing.

61
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,510
The other thing that is very
cool is the device metric.

62
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,910
You could now basically enter
any device metric that you

63
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,920
want to check.

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,490
But even more cool than that--
and you saw here, of course,

65
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,790
that it's just changing.

66
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,800
If you're overriding the
user agent, it will

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,330
automatically fit it.

68
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,320
So if I'm working now on iPhone
5, you could see that

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,995
it filled for me the
device metric.

70
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,480
And that's a great thing because
it's just letting you

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,850
work with the exact device
that you wish and get the

72
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,810
exact screen resolution
that you have there.

73
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,050
So that's one very cool feature
that we have today.

74
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,600
And basically, there's
a ton of other

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,530
features in the settings.

76
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,860
So if you want to drill down it
and see exactly what you're

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,590
getting there, this
in the new view.

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,490
Another very important thing
is to emulate Touch Event.

79
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,120
So if I'm clicking this
checkbox, from now on, I'll

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,160
get Touch Event.

81
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,080
And specifically for mobile
applications, this is very,

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,760
very crucial.

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,700
So we don't need to use what
we used in the past, like

84
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,890
listening to an extra event and
then have the ability to

85
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,180
have Click Event and
Touch Event.

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,770
Here what we're doing is
pretty straightforward.

87
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,480
We're just emulating
Touch Event.

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,940
And from now on, our regular
Chrome in our desktop

89
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,320
environment will act and will
fire those touch events.

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,310
So that's another pretty
cool new add-in.

91
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,980
Other things that we have in
Chrome Dev Tools are actually

92
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,540
under the Experiments.

93
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,650
And the experiments flag could
be triggered on by just going

94
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,400
to Chrome Flags.

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,520
Let me open it and just
show it to you.

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,350
So here, basically, you're
seeing all the different

97
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,210
experiments that you could
do today under Chrome.

98
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,680
The list is very long,
as you can see.

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,820
And what I really like in it is
that if you search just for

100
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,620
Dev Tools--

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,050
tools, yeah--

102
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,030
so enable Developer Tools
Experiments--

103
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,550
and in my case, it's
already enabled--

104
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,420
you could see things--

105
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,670
sorry, it's not enabled.

106
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,280
Let me enable it.

107
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Or even better, yeah.

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,460
Let me enable it here.

109
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,550
OK.

110
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,740
And now if I go here
and reload it--

111
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,980

112
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,110
Yeah, basically I need
to restart Chrome.

113
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,150
Let me just get Chrome
restarted, the Chrome that I'm

114
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,090
using, and I'll open it again.

115
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,080
And then you'll be able to see
what did the flag that I

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
opened in the experiment.

117
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,945
Basically, we get another
tab under the Dev Tools.

118
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:40,280
And this tab will be all the new
experiments that you could

119
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,560
do, all the different features
that you want

120
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,770
to use will be there.

121
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,060
So let me just show
this to you.

122
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,780
Yeah, this is the wrong
program now.

123
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:59,150
And here we go.

124
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,700
OK.

125
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,066
Let's take this one.

126
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:09,078
And I'm opening it.

127
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:15,550
Yeah, so let's do another
new screen share.

128
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,760
And yes.

129
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,330
So now, basically what
you can see here--

130
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,970
and let me try just to
make it even larger.

131
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,150
OK, so you see here, I how
have a new tab called

132
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,430
Experiment.

133
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,000
And these experiments could give
you the new things that

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,290
are going to be baked in Chrome,
hopefully in that

135
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,060
feature, and in that form and
shape, maybe a bit differently

136
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,690
in the future.

137
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,010
But at least you could play
with them now and see

138
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,880
how they look like.

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,000
Show CPU activity and timelines,
or override the

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,415
device geolocation, orientation,
support SASS,

141
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,056
lots of very, very
cool things.

142
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:57,760
The Snippets support is one of
the things that I really like.

143
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,690
And you could actually drive
into JSON objects and see them

144
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,820
in a very nice format in
the console today.

145
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,730
So that's something that
we should open.

146
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,645
And another very important thing
that I see more and more

147
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,280
web developers are using these
days is the ability

148
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,650
to disable the cache.

149
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,890
So if you are working now, you
definitely don't want to be

150
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,630
miserable and try to figure
out if it's a

151
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,090
cache resource or not.

152
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,940
Probably at the beginning
of your development, the

153
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,440
prototyping, you want just to
make sure that the cache is

154
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,510
disabled, and each and every
time that you're hitting the

155
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,770
server, you're getting
the latest version.

156
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,210
Just check this option,
and you are a good.

157
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,000
Other cool things that
you could do here is

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,640
enable source map.

159
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,660
Source map is the option
to work with the

160
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,260
original form of the file.

161
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,700
So let's say that you have
in your build system a

162
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,080
notification for
your JavaScript

163
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,050
or some other phase.

164
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,210
Let's say, if you're working
with Dart and you have it

165
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,370
compiled to JavaScript,
basically with source map, you

166
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,890
could debug with the
original code base.

167
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,840
And that's, of course, extremely
useful, specifically

168
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,120
when you're working in those
cases that you don't want to

169
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,530
work with a code that's
been magnified.

170
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,950
You just want to work with
the source of it.

171
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,480
What other cool things
that I worked?

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,520
The ability to log
XHR is very nice.

173
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,040
And just to see the shadow dome
in places that you're

174
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,790
working with them is also
a very nice thing.

175
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,510
In terms of rendering, to show
the repaint rectangulars, it's

176
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,520
very nice just to have this
organization what's going on

177
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,050
with your site in terms
of rendering.

178
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,390
That's basically most of the
things that I wanted to dig

179
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,010
from Dev Tools inside
the settings.

180
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,900
Another other great capability
that had been covered in last

181
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,730
Google I/O was the ability how
to debug mobile websites.

182
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,160
Let me just show you where
you could find it.

183
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,930

184
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,540
So, yeah.

185
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's close this one.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,870
In the blog post that I'm going
to launch very soon, you

187
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,800
have here, basically, a great
talk by Pavel and Sam about

188
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,500
Dev Tools and how they allow you
to debug and be efficient

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,855
when you're working on
your mobile web apps.

190
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:35,790
That's something that I highly
encourage you to check out

191
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,210
I think we are in a quite
good timing so far.

192
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,016
I really apologize for
the people that were

193
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,720
here exactly at 2:00.

194
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,840
I had a bit of problems with
installing the new plug-in.

195
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,170
And that's why I couldn't
do it on air on time.

196
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,730
But I promise that the next
episode up here will be at

197
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,790
exactly 2:00 and not
2-0-something.

198
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,950
So until next time, thank
you very much.

199
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,680
And as always, if you have any
questions or feedback, just

200
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,765
feel free to reach
out to me on G+.

201
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:13,010
Just google greenido.

202
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,590
Or if you want, on Twitter,
greenido is one word as well.

203
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,260
And if you have a cool start-up
that you want to show

204
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,190
cast in this episode, just feel
free to reach out to me.

205
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,350
I'll share show notes for these
episodes on my blog.

206
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,550
And I'll put a link there
for people that want

207
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,710
to be on the show.

208
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,780
Just fill a short form, and
then we'll contact you.

209
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,660
We have quite a lot of very
interesting episodes that

210
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,850
we're going to run in
the next few weeks.

211
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,730
Some of them will be based on
great people that I met

212
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,125
yesterday in DLD Tel Aviv.

213
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:55,070
It's a big, big Yossi Vardi
festival and lots of great

214
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,620
VCs, NGOs, and developers
were there.

215
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,930
We had two amazing events--

216
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,360
Google for Women
Entrepreneurship 2.0, and the

217
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,110
other was what Android can do.

218
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,870
And for people in Israel that
are not part of the GDG, I

219
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,900
highly encourage you
to check it out.

220
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,560
They are almost biweekly
or monthly meetings.

221
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,650
And in most of them, you have
great speakers, great content.

222
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,750
And you're just meeting very
cool people that are all

223
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,570
passionate about Android,
Chrome, HTML5, and what's cool

224
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,030
on the web with or without
Google platforms.

225
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,720
So just feel free to
hang out with us.

226
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,600
And thank you very much.

227
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,850
Bye-bye.

228
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,292
