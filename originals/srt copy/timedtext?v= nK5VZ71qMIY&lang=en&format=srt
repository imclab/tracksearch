Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Google
Chrome Project Management Director Brian Rakowski.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,400
>> RAKOWSKI: Hello, everybody. It’s so nice
to see everybody here to hear about extensions.

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,509
It looks a little bit crowded back there.
There’s lots of room up here. Don’t be

4
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:30,450
shy. There’s room in the front if you need
a little bit more space. We have a lot to

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,110
talk about here. We’re going to talk about
extensions and what we released yesterday.

6
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,440
But before we do that, I want to take a couple
of minutes to talk about the browser in Chrome

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,410
and what it means to us at Google. So we set
out to build a browser because browsers are

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,670
so important to us. We think that a browser
is the most important piece of software on

9
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,510
your computer. We spend all day in front of
browsers everyday. I’m sure a lot of you

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,260
do, too. All of our users come to us to through
the browser, and we wanted to make sure that

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:04,009
there was a really rock-solid set of fundamentals
that supported the browser and gave us a great

12
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,439
platform to build on, and also a great user
experience. So, with that in mind, we set

13
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,330
out to make a browser that was fundamentally
faster, safer, and more stable than what we’ve

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,360
seen before. So, with that in mind, we’ve
put a lot of effort in to some of our core

15
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,080
technology. V8 helps us with speed. Our multi-process
architecture helps us with stability. And

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,270
our sandboxing technology helps us with security.
All these things are very, very important

17
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,750
to us. They also help us with extensions.
And you’ll hear more about that as we get

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,750
a little bit further into the presentation.
So far, the response to Chrome has been amazing.

19
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,100
We’ve been overwhelmed by how positively
people have responded. We’ve got over 40

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,189
million regular users of Chrome. We’re blown
away by the response there. We have continued

21
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:58,659
to improve on our core fundamentals of speed,
security, stability. You can see here that

22
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,570
our performance on JavaScript execution has
improved by 150% since we first launched the

23
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,770
browser; something we’re very proud of.
We’ve also worked on DOM manipulations.

24
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,540
For pages that try to manipulate the DOM through
JavaScript, we’ve made huge strides in the

25
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,760
last release; so we’re very proud of that
as well. We’re also rounding out the feature

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,860
set. There’s a bunch of features that we
consider to be basic features that a browser

27
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,300
needs. And we’ve been rounding those out
for the last four releases of the browser.

28
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,530
We’ve also added a little bit some more
frivolous features, I guess; something a little

29
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,470
bit more fun in themes. In case you have an
urge to put Mariah Carey's face on your browser,

30
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,910
you can now do that. People seem to really
like that feature. So, we’ve made a lot

31
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,120
of progress in the last year. We’re really
proud of what we’ve done. A big gap for

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,430
the last year has been our lack of support
for Mac and Linux. We can finally cross that

33
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,510
off the list. And, of course, the other big
gap is extensions. And that’s what we’re

34
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,200
here to talk today. We’ve also made a huge
investment in the platform. We want the platform

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,459
to be more powerful in terms of what users
can see and what developers can deliver to

36
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,060
users on the platform. So we’ve made a huge
investment in HTML5. We're delivering lots

37
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,690
of capabilities there. We’ve also made a
big investment in developer tools, and that

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,989
team is to deliver some cool enhancements
to developer tools. And you’ll see some

39
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:23,099
of that in the talk that Aaron and Erik are
going to deliver. But we’re going to spend

40
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,099
all of our--the rest of the time talking about
extensions. And extensions are incredibly

41
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,250
important to us. When we built Chrome, we
wanted to focus on creating a very simple

42
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,030
user experience that evoke the Google aesthetic
of being very powerful but didn’t have a

43
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,159
lot of features that got in your way. It wasn’t
intimidating in any way. And that was our

44
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,860
core--one of our core principles of simplicity,
or as we like to say, content not Chrome.

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,489
But when we started to work on extensions,
we wanted to adhere to that same aesthetics.

46
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,830
So you’ll see throughout the talk some of
the work we’ve done to make sure that that

47
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,909
stayed as simple as possible. Now, one of
the things we learned as we started to hear

48
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,860
our users’ feedback after the first year
of Chrome was that every user has the handful

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,590
of extensions or handful of features that
they cannot live without. But those same features

50
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,659
to 90% of users are called bloat. So, our
answer to that is extensions. And this is

51
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,520
an area we’re very serious. We’re going
to put a lot of effort into making extensions

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,199
more and more powerful over time. But the
start we have is phenomenal. And without anymore

53
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,949
background, I’m going to hand it over to
Erik and Aaron to talk about what we set out

54
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,589
to build, how we built it, and how it all
works. So, here, we have Aaron Boodman and

55
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:37,879
Erik Kay to talk about the rest of it.
