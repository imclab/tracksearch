Hi I am Erik and I am a software engineer
working on Google Chrome extensions.

2
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:11,160
In this video I am going to talk about the
user interface for extensions.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,059
Google Chrome's user-interface design emphasizes
"content, not chrome" which means we try to

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,250
minimize the amount of screen real-estate
the browser UI uses in order to allow the

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,640
user to focus more on the content of the web.
For Google Chrome extensions, we wanted to

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,140
make sure we preserved Google Chrome's minimalist
aesthetic.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,900
Extensions in other browsers have a reputation
for doing things like filling your browser

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,989
with toolbars, or covering every possible
surface of your browser with their UI, leaving

9
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,559
no room for the content itself.
With Google Chrome extensions, we've decided

10
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,289
to take the approach that an extension is
only allowed a single UI surface, and that

11
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,929
UI surface will be minimal.
We also believe that users should control

12
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,620
where and when extension UI is displayed,
so it should be easy to hide and remove any

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,649
unwanted user interface.
While developing Google Chrome extensions,

14
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,859
we experimented with a number of other UI
surfaces, and we kept pushing them to make

15
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,420
them simpler and more minimal.
Those that didn't feel like they fit our UI

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,620
philosophy were eventually cut.
The content-not-chrome philosophy extends

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,220
to the types of extensions that we'd like
to enable as well.

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,040
Rather than focusing too much on changing
particulars of Google Chrome's interface,

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,580
we've designed the extension system to be
about interacting with the web.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,550
Google Chrome extensions are primarily about
adding functionality to web pages, or providing

21
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,180
access to or integration with the content
from web sites.

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,940
They're not about changing the appearance
of the tabs or rearranging the menus.

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,030
The simplest bit of extensions UI is the browser
action.

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,320
A browser action is a simple button that is
added to the main toolbar to the right of

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,920
the omnibox.
The extension can change the icon on the button,

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,390
depending on the content on the current page,
even animating it.

27
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,030
Extensions can also simply add colored badges
of text over their icons.

28
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,210
These badges are ideal for counters or small
status indicators.

29
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,909
In addition to simply performing actions,
browser actions can also show popup bubbles.

30
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,909
Pop ups are built using HTML and are sized
dynamically based on the contents.

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,819
Page actions are similar to browser actions,
but they're in the omnibox and they appear

32
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,010
and disappear based on the contents of the
page.

33
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,760
Like browser actions, page actions can display
pop ups, but they don't support badges.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,150
The rule of thumb about when to use each is
that a browser action should almost always

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,040
be valid - for example, "blog about this page"
or "show the current weather forecast" - , while

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,120
page actions should only apply to some pages
based on their content - for example "map

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,120
address on this page".
Another approach for extension UI is to use

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,270
the content of the page itself.
This can be the ultimate in the minimalist

39
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,319
approach, taking up no space in the browser's
chrome itself.

40
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,370
For example, an extension might turn the results
of an image search into a slide show, completely

41
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:08,090
using in-page UI.
With the extension system itself, our team

42
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,690
wanted it to feel lightweight and unobtrusive.
For example, when you install extensions,

43
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,030
they immediately appear and are usable.
You're not prompted when extensions update

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,540
themselves, and you never need to restart
the browser, even when you disable or uninstall

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,920
an extension.
In the future, we will likely provide web

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,160
developers with access to more surfaces.
However, we will always do this carefully

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,540
with the user's interests in mind. We welcome
your suggestions in our discussion group.
