Hi, I'm Boris, an engineer
working in

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,850
Chrome developer relations.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,880
Today, I'd like to show you
how to use the remote

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,360
debugging feature in Chrome
for Android Beta.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,760
Before you get started, make
sure you've installed the

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,440
Android SDK, which includes
the Android

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,790
Debug Bridge utility.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,490
Once ADB is installed,
run the following

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,740
command in your terminal.

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,070

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,220
Next, enable remote debugging in
Chrome for Android by going

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,870
to Settings, Developer Tools,
and enabling the option.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,550
Now, you'll be able to view all
open tabs in Chrome for

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,620
Android by accessing local
host on port 9222 in your

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,790
desktop browser.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,800
Clicking a link in your desktop
browser opens the

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,790
Chrome developer tools
for that tab.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,260
Here, you can see the Chrome
developer tools inspecting

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,560
your mobile browser.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,200
As you'd expect, hovering over
an element in the inspector

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,500
highlights it in the browser.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,040

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,370
You can manipulate the page
using the same Chrome

25
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,350
developer tools you're
used to.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,450
Here, I've hidden an element
by setting it's CSS display

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,134
property to none.

28
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:23,990

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,170
You can also run scripts
in-line.

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,815
Here, I've created an alert
in the inspected page.

31
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:33,000

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Remote debugging gives you
access to these, and many

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,700
other, powerful dev tools
features, such as live

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,440
editing, HTML, CSS, and
Javascript, breakpoints, and

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,690
code beautification.

36
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,350

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,095
