KAY: Hi, everyone, my name is Erik Kay. This
is Aaron Boodman. And we're really excited

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:17,750
to be here for launching Chrome Extensions
into beta after a year of hard work. So, 15

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,570
months ago when Chrome was first launched,
one of the first things we heard from our

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,690
users was asking us about extensions. And,
in fact, it's the oldest open issue in our

5
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:35,690
bug database, issue 18th. So, it got filed,
literally, minutes after we launched. And

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,930
FIT was soon filled with hundreds--a hundred
comments or more of people saying, “Yes,

7
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,970
plus 1, me too.” You know, all the really
helpful comments that, you know, that people

8
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,710
really want this. So, after it got a little
bit out of hand, we locked down the bug for

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,710
further comments and finally said, “Yes,
okay. We’re working on extensions.”

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:01,000
>> BOODMAN: Somebody commented in the times
since we opened this up.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
>> KAY: Uh-oh. Well, so today, I'm glad to
say that we're finally marking the bug fixed.

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,090
So, when we announced that we were starting
it, we got a lot sort of surprise reactions

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,429
from people saying that, “Not only don't
you have extensions, but you haven't even

14
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:29,590
started them yet.” Like, and the reason
that reaction was there was because a lot

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,539
of pioneering work that Firefox and the Mozilla
community have done to really make extensions

16
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:38,780
to be unexpected feature for the browser.
So, it's now something that people demand

17
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,780
and people want in browsers. However, the
problem with extensions is that when you build

18
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:51,659
them, they really depend on all the lowest
level parts of the browser. So, when we were

19
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,039
developing Chrome before we launched, lots
of stuff was moving around. It was pretty

20
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,399
chaotic and it wasn't really a good place
for us to start building extensions. It wasn't

21
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,159
until we released, that things got a little
bit more stabilized, that we really had a

22
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,940
solid foundation to start building on. So,
one of the interesting side effects of waiting,

23
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,790
the way we did, was that we were open sourcing
public from day one. With that means is that

24
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,390
our very first design document about extensions
was published from the Internet directly.

25
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,370
It was about a year ago in November. And since
then, we've been continuing to publish updates

26
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,849
and examples and sample code and get feedback
from the community, which helped keep us on

27
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,010
the right track. One of the other interesting
side effects of this is that a lot of you

28
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,590
in the audience probably got much earlier
access to the code than you would have otherwise

29
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,840
gotten. And in fact, the first extension that
was written outside of Google was written

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,689
literally hours after we checked in the code
that enabled it. It's been really exciting

31
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:51,870
to work this closely with the community and
we're really excited to keep working that

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,870
way going forward. So, when we started designing
Chrome Extensions, how do we start? We started

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,799
with Chrome’s design principles and said,
“How can we make extensions that fit into

34
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,420
that?” Well, first, basically, we built
on the open Web. We worked hard to make them

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,579
Webby, this makes some fun and easy to develop.
People can use their existing skills and it

36
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,750
grows with the Web platform. We kept the UI
streamlined. Chrome is all about wrapping

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,700
powerful functionality and a streamlined user
interphase. We believe that a fast browser

38
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,360
enables richer set of applications than could
be done before, and keeps people more productive.

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,469
And that's especially important today because
we're all spending a lot more time in front

40
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,189
of our browsers. Not only are we spending
more time but we're doing lots of things at

41
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,890
same time. We got a lot of Tabs and Windows
opened. So, it's important that the browser

42
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,480
remains stable. You don't want it to crash
and lose all your work, and so it's important

43
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,010
that a single extension can't take down your
browser. Further today, we're doing many more

44
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,480
of our more sensitive activities online as
well, whether it's just email or paying bills

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,909
or doing your taxes. It's important that the
browser stays secure. So, an extension that's

46
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:10,939
insecure shouldn’t be able to compromise
this core security of the browser itself.

47
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,239
So, what are extensions anyway? Extensions
are just Zip files that are collections of

48
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,060
Web pages and their associated resources,
like, images and CSS files. So, if you remember

49
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,010
one thing from today's presentation, this
should be it. Extensions are just Web pages.

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,470
And a lot of really cool things fall out of
this as a result. First, extensions are really

51
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,140
easy to write. It's easy as writing a Web
page. If you're a Web developer, you get to

52
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,480
reuse all your existing skills and knowledge.
You can use all of the powerful tools that

53
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,670
you’re used to using to develop Web pages
to build extensions. You can also take advantage

54
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,310
of the largest developer community in the
world for any platform. The Web platform has

55
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,540
more developers than any other platform. On
top of that with Chrome, you can take advantage

56
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,470
of future looking technologies. Things that
are--that are--that normally wouldn’t necessarily

57
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:08,410
see as much of in the WildWeb, HTML5, Workers,
Canvas, video, Web sockets, things from WebKit,

58
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:15,160
CSS3, you know, reflections and gradients,
lots of cool stuff that we take for granted

59
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,230
on the Chrome team, but maybe you're out seeing
in the WildWeb. And you get to depend on having

60
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,440
lightning fast JavaScript in your browser
with V8.
