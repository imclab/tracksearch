PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

4
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:29,380
I'm Paul Kinlan.

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,229
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

6
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,800
And I've been working on the
Web Lab project with these

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,660
guys here, Roger and Mattias.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,080
That's right?

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,740
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,180
PAUL KINLAN: Yes!

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,910
I've got it right again.

12
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,850
So guys, do you want to give
yourself a little bit of

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,980
introduction about who
you are, what you do,

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,350
where you're from.

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,495
ROGER PALA: I'm Roger.

16
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm from Barcelona.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,050
I'm a creative technologist
at B-Reel.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,650
And I've been the technical
leader of this project.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,523
MATTIAS EKENDAHL:
And I'm Mattias.

20
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:57,730
I'm a creative technologist
as well.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,850
I'm from some Uppsala, a
small city in Sweden.

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,269
And I've been working mainly
on the Orchestra.

23
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,170
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,100
So, yes.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,950
Today's talk. at least, Is about
the Universal Orchestra

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,180
Experiment.

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,500
For those who don't know about
Web Lab, I'll just give you a

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,570
little bit of a background
to it.

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,350
Web Lab is a series of five
real-world Chrome experiments

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,210
based inside the British Science
Museum here in London,

31
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,660
but with a real, solid
internet presence.

32
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,220
So every experiment that you
can interact with at the

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,990
museum, you can also interact
with at home online and work

34
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,100
through your browser.

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,320
Now, the really interesting
thing as well, for me at

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,220
least, are the experiences that
you have on your desktop

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,090
machine are really quite similar
to the experiences

38
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,210
that you have inside
the museum itself.

39
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,580
So that's pretty cool.

40
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,400
The second most important thing
is that everything you

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,880
do inside the museum is recorded
against your own

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,830
unique lab tag, which if you
watch the Lab Tag Explorer

43
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,440
Hangout that we did earlier
on, you will see that

44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,890
basically you can go home, put
your camera or put the lab tag

45
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,407
up in front of your camera,
and then get access to

46
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:08,235
everything that you just created
in the museum as well

47
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:09,449
as online, as well.

48
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,960
So it's a pretty cool
experience, right?

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,830
And today is the piece
de resistance.

50
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,890
I don't know whether that's
right or what I'm saying.

51
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,930
It's one of the best things
about the museum, is the

52
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,180
Universal Orchestra Experiment,
which, if we've

53
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,222
done this right, you'll hear
in the background.

54
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:30,230
[TONES PLAY]

55
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,670
PAUL KINLAN: Playing.

56
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,860
So the Universal Orchestra,
I think it's about eight

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,600
instruments.

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:35,970
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,860
Eight instruments.

60
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,430
PAUL KINLAN: Eight physical,
real instruments.

61
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,720
As you can see in the background
right now, we've

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,130
got drums, marimbas.

63
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,850
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Kalimba.

64
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,690
PAUL KINLAN: Yes, kalim--
there's like all these

65
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,320
instruments I'd never
heard of, right?

66
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,920
Ever.

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,190
They're awesome,
though, right?

68
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,740
And you can interact
with them either at

69
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,150
the museum or online.

70
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,066
And you can make a band.

71
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:57,290
The two join together.

72
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,480
For me, this is the experiment
where both sides kind of come

73
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,810
together into one
big experience.

74
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,280
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

75
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,720
And the thought behind this
is to show real-time

76
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,770
collaboration and that
the internet is

77
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,970
facilitating that for you.

78
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,290
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

79
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,390
It's pretty cool.

80
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,540
So shall we dive in?

81
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,010
ROGER PALA: Yep.

82
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,190
Let's have a look.

83
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,210
PAUL KINLAN: As with every
Hangout, I normally mention

84
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,650
how this was made.

85
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,590
I only learned this myself just
recently, and I'm not

86
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,710
going to tell you.

87
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,970
No, it was--

88
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,470
was it Swiffy?

89
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:27,880
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

90
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,975
PAUL KINLAN: It was a Flash
file, Swiffy-ized, which is a

91
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:34,690
Google Tool on
chrome.google.com, passed

92
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,580
through that and made in
HTML and JavaScript.

93
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,060
So this is actually really
interesting right now, is we

94
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,470
have two different modes.

95
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,610
We have the real-time mode,
and we're going

96
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,760
to go through both.

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,840
So this a longer-than-normal
Hangout, essentially.

98
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,590
But we're going to
go through both.

99
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,620
One is the online version, which
I say online, the one

100
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,142
that interacts with the
real instruments.

101
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,510
But sometimes those instruments
might be fully

102
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,950
booked up with people playing
online at the time or inside

103
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,550
the museum.

104
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,740
And you can get a pure online
virtual experience as well.

105
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,930
We'll dive into the real museum,
the real experience,

106
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,360
the museum experience first.

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,240
Now, the really cool thing about
this to me is this is a

108
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,840
live stream of the
museum, isn't it?

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,329
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

110
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,930
PAUL KINLAN: It's only
like a couple of

111
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,910
seconds delayed, is it?

112
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,700
A few seconds of delay?

113
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,210
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, I think
around here, it might be

114
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,510
4 or 5 seconds, and then
when you get in

115
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,600
live, it's 3 seconds.

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,940
PAUL KINLAN: So it's
pretty cool, this.

117
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,760
Well, it's buffering
right now, but I'll

118
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,530
blame YouTube for that.

119
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,160
So we'll jump into
it at least.

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,960
So we'll jump in.

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,990
Again, this is the live view
of the experiment.

122
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,030
We have our different
instruments.

123
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,280
There is one person playing
at the moment.

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,484
Which is a good instrument?

125
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,670
Should we jump in and play an
instrument straight away?

126
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,020
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Let's go
for the steel drums.

127
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,550
PAUL KINLAN: Steel drums?

128
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,430
There we are.

129
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,860
So we'll join in the queue.

130
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,880
So this is the steel
drum playing at the

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
museum right now.

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,825
There is no one in the queue for
this one, so we should be

133
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,562
able to jump on pretty quick.

134
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,815
I imagined if we joined
at a busy time, we'd

135
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:05,895
have a bit of a wait.

136
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:06,220
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

137
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,940
And during the opening time of
the museum, four instruments

138
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,450
are reserved for museum users.

139
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,830
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

140
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,210
I mean, that was actually-- when
I took the kids to the

141
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,260
museum, that was a good thing,
is that we could

142
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,200
actually get on.

143
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,640
I was worried about people
coming online and stealing an

144
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,550
instrument from me.

145
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,765
But it wasn't like that.

146
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,340
I got to play it myself.

147
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,590
So let's join the queue.

148
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,270

149
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,210
And then it should-- it says
less than a minute, so we'll

150
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,290
have a chat for a minute.

151
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,970
Hey, we're done.

152
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,890
So we're in.

153
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,050
We have a minute to respond.

154
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,770
I'm ready.

155
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,900
Let's jump in.

156
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,950
I love how this whole experiment
is like all the

157
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,040
experiments-- seamless
navigation between the views.

158
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,410
It's pretty cool.

159
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,520
So we've actually got six
different notes that we can

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,690
play on this grid.

161
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,860
If you're familiar with the
MIDI synthesizers and

162
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,210
sequencers and all that
type of stuff, it's a

163
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,510
similar type of thing.

164
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,200
Should we put some on?

165
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,570
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

166
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,820
PAUL KINLAN: Well, should we
have a listen to what's

167
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,007
playing in the background
first?

168
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:04,930
[MUSIC PLAYING]

169
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,170
PAUL KINLAN: Sounds cool.

170
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,590
So what you'll find is as while
we're actually doing

171
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,370
this, we can't actually hear
what's happening, because

172
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,740
otherwise, the microphone
audio will be

173
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,815
a little bit crazy.

174
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:16,340
But we have two instruments
left that we can position.

175
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,620
Can you explain to me a little
bit about what's going on, why

176
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,960
the button kind of glowed and
slowly went out, and wasn't

177
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,820
there straight away?

178
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,080
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes.

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,410
So normally, when it comes to
real-time collaboration,

180
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,440
people don't see the latency,
which here is 3 seconds, and

181
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,450
we wanted to show it.

182
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,900
So it's actually, you have done
something, but it hasn't

183
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,030
happened yet.

184
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,710
So that's what we're showing
off, and that's why the

185
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,960
physics of the globes
are as they are.

186
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,970
So if you drag one, it will
stop, and you release it, and

187
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,360
you know it's going
to get there.

188
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,790
But it hasn't yet got there,
so now it has.

189
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,585
PAUL KINLAN: I like that.

190
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:55,920
Thank you.

191
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,530
So it's kind of interesting,
because what we're trying to

192
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,860
show is that actually, there's
up to eight different

193
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,740
participants, and they're all--
they all need to be

194
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,755
synchronized to hear the same
piece of music roughly about

195
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:05,880
the same time.

196
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,620
Otherwise, it would just be a
terrible music experience, if

197
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,940
it wasn't playing it out.

198
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,130
So the other video before
was YouTube live.

199
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,200
Is this a YouTube live
video, or is this--

200
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,500
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No.

201
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,450
This is one with lower latency,
so we're going

202
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,650
directly to the source and
getting the video from there.

203
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,210
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, pretty cool.

204
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,475
So I pretty much see what's
happening with a minimal delay

205
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:26,980
between the two.

206
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,690
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

207
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,820
And we wanted to make sure that
the audio was in sync

208
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,680
with the initials as well, so
that's where the 3-second

209
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,930
buffering time comes from.

210
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,890
PAUL KINLAN: I realized that.

211
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,100
It feels nice, right?

212
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,860
Well, it feels slower.

213
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,770
Not slow.

214
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,156
It feels gluey.

215
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:45,580
It's like, oh, you
get it across.

216
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,455
But it feels kind of nice, the
way that you're showing that

217
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,470
there is latency.

218
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,335
Normally what happens on
the web, it's terrible.

219
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,442
They use a white screen, or
you'll see things kind of load

220
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:55,726
in and all that type of stuff.

221
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,560
It feels kind of nice, the
way that this is--

222
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,200
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Or it could
be faked as well, kind of

223
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,900
showing a delay when
you actually know

224
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,420
what's going to happen.

225
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,650
But this is what's going on.

226
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:06,890
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

227
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,710
This is pretty cool.

228
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,140
So I mean, this is going
to sound silly, right?

229
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,230
What is the--

230
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,130
is this Canvas?

231
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,190
Just a Canvas thing?

232
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,550
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

233
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,413
It's a 2-D Canvas drawing
everything on every frame.

234
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:25,830

235
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,220
PAUL KINLAN: How are the clients
all synchronized?

236
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,600
I mean, it's pretty hard to
synchronize two people

237
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,010
together just normally.

238
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,740
I mean, you've got eight people
synchronized now with

239
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,280
this with a user interface.

240
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,100
Can you explain a little
bit how the actual

241
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,640
synchronization works?

242
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:39,950
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes.

243
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,560
So everyone gets the time from
the timestamp in the video.

244
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,550
So it doesn't matter what your
clocks say on the system.

245
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,740
It's what the video says the
time is that dictates how it's

246
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
going to be shown.

247
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,230
And then we're using WebSockets
to broadcast all

248
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,590
the messages to everyone.

249
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,230
So here in a matter of
milliseconds, they can see

250
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,790
what's happening.

251
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,260
PAUL KINLAN: OK, So
something happens,

252
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,540
basically, on the client.

253
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,670
You'll send it to the server
via WebSocket as well.

254
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,140
And then do you have to wait for
it to be synchronized on

255
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,130
the service before you
then send that back

256
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,950
out to all the clients?

257
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,790
Is that what you're saying?

258
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,140
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

259
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,470
So we have the real-time server
that takes care of all

260
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,500
that synchronization, sends it
to the museum, and gets a

261
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,520
reply back, I'm going to play
this note at this time, sends

262
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,280
it out to everyone else.

263
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,460
But before it got the reply
from the museum, it has

264
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,990
already broadcasted out this
is going to happen.

265
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,020
We just--

266
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,692
PAUL KINLAN: I got you.

267
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,600
It sends a confirmation.

268
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,100
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

269
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,600
You just don't know the time
when it's going to happen, but

270
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
it's coming.

271
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,900
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

272
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,160
So I mean, App Engine doesn't
support WebSockets, right?

273
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,210
And you're using WebSockets.

274
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,250
So how did you actually
build that part out?

275
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,940
Was it like a NoJS server
or something?

276
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,860
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes,
so we have--

277
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,500
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, sweet.

278
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,090
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: A NoJS
server, so all

279
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,840
the JavaScript running.

280
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,710
PAUL KINLAN: Is it
a lot of code?

281
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,426
I imagine it's not.

282
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,000
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's
not that much.

283
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,530
And we implemented the
WebSockets from scratch, just

284
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,630
reading the specification
and sending as

285
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,140
small messages as possible.

286
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,440
And they are around 4 or
5 bytes, every message

287
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,330
that are sent out.

288
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:25,910
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
small, isn't it?

289
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,520
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

290
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,630
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

291
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,080
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And we use App
Engine for the queueing.

292
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,580
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, actually,
we didn't talk about that.

293
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,520
So how does the queueing work?

294
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,390
Because I can imagine that
there's only four instruments

295
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,460
that you can play any
one particular time.

296
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,150
If you have a lot of people
visiting the museum, obviously

297
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,850
they can queue up in
a physical line.

298
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,240
I mean, if you're online,
how does that work?

299
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,690
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: So what we saw
earlier was the little bar

300
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,610
at the top saying how far you
are into the queue and how

301
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,950
long you have to wait.

302
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,040
And so people are just queueing
up, and if you're

303
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,640
queueing, you can say the
virtual experience to interact

304
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,530
with other while
you're waiting.

305
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,680
PAUL KINLAN: So what type of
technology do you use in the

306
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,950
back end to actually
manage the queue?

307
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,490
Is it just you pull
every so often?

308
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,270
Or is it tasked?

309
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,740
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, it's
pulling, which App Engine's

310
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,760
good at doing.

311
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,210
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

312
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,580
It's pretty good at scaling
that stuff up.

313
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,500
That's pretty interesting.

314
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,770
So it is literally a first-in,
first-out queue?

315
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,242
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

316
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,186
PAUL KINLAN: You just basically
manage and kind of

317
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:32,130
pop it off.

318
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,486
That's pretty cool.

319
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,070
That was actually quicker than
I thought it would be.

320
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,570
Shall we have a look at the
live online experience?

321
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,990
This is actually pretty
cool as well.

322
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,690
So the thing I like about the
museum one is you literally

323
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,300
are playing the instruments with
people in the museum, and

324
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,120
you get the live stream back,
and it's pretty nice.

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,300
What should we say about the
Play Online version?

326
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,730
Why was this created?

327
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,440
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Just for
more people to play.

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,210
We were thinking, if it's a long
queue, then people will

329
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,860
still want to do something,
and having a virtual one

330
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,730
enables us to have hundreds of
users at the same time instead

331
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,930
of just eight.

332
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,350
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

333
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,760
That's pretty cool.

334
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,885
So let's load the sequencer
and see how it goes.

335
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:20,960

336
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,500
Fundamentally, this seems like
a relatively similar concept

337
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,050
between the real physical
machine, the installation

338
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,560
version, and the actual
online version.

339
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,370
I mean, is it literally
the same code?

340
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,600
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, for
the display and for the

341
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,740
interaction between it.

342
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:45,155
But then here we using audio API
to play the samples, which

343
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:49,130
are taken from the instruments
in the museum.

344
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,400
PAUL KINLAN: Cool, So
how would you play--

345
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,246
I mean, I'm just going
to put some stuff.

346
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:54,200
Well, there's actually quite
a few people playing now.

347
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
So let's play the--

348
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,390
the--

349
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,030
thing.

350
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,240
[LAUGHTER]

351
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,670
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know
what it's called.

352
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,970
That's pretty cool.

353
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,740
I like that.

354
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,990
It's nice.

355
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,610

356
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,390
So yeah, I mean--

357
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,330
what was the question?

358
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,220
Yeah, so how do you
actually play?

359
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,720
I mean, you said you were
playing the audio back, and

360
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,390
you presampled the sounds.

361
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,175
The audio tag in most browsers
is known to be very sensitive

362
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:24,830
to latency.

363
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,060
I say sensitive.

364
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,830
It's very latent, has
high latency.

365
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,870
I mean, how did you
get around this?

366
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,470
Because it seems like it's
pretty responsive.

367
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,480
As soon as it says it's going
to play, it plays it.

368
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,030
How did you do that?

369
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,290
Did you use the audio tag?

370
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,330
Web Audio?

371
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,290
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: We're using
Web Audio for this one, which

372
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,630
is perfect for this kind, and
you can just tell it when to

373
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,960
start playing a sound, and it
plays exactly at that point.

374
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,630
So we have a background loop of
four bars, and then we add

375
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,000
on on top of that.

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,010
And everything stays
synchronized, which would be

377
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,743
impossible with the audio tag.

378
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:03,470
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

379
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,550
I imagine as well you don't
think we need an amazing

380
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,400
amount of --

381
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,130
like every client to be
amazingly in sequence with

382
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,770
each of these now, because it's
not playing the physical

383
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,490
instrument and streaming
it back out.

384
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,180
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: So they're
actually playing.

385
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,990
You don't know if they are at
the same bar as you, but they

386
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,620
get your changes.

387
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,690
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: This
is pretty cool.

388
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,150
I really like the effect that
when two people are sharing

389
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:32,390
the same note, essentially, at
the same time, it's get a nice

390
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,820
little animation.

391
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,150
I presume that's just
a normal Canvas

392
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,170
animation between the two.

393
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:35,580
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

394
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,380
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

395
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,920
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

396
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,210
So I mean, you have
this button here

397
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,940
that says Record Session.

398
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,380
How does that work?

399
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,010
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: So that one,
we are just recording all the

400
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,310
changes and what's been playing,
and when we play it

401
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,290
back, we start the same thing.

402
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,880
We start a player in this
interface to show it off.

403
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,430
So it doesn't generate
an audio file.

404
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,600
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so it's
not generating--

405
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,540
yeah, that's pretty cool.

406
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,850
So it's not generating a
physical audio file.

407
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,760
It generates like a MIDI file,
essentially, where the notes

408
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,350
are playing at a particular
time and then you just

409
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,920
rerecord that.

410
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,890
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

411
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,550
PAUL KINLAN: So if I press
Stop, does it cancel it?

412
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,730
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It
will cancel it.

413
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,360
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, I'll
leave that.

414
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,630
I'll let it go for another
4 seconds then.

415
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,515
This is pretty cool.

416
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,010
So let's see if this works.

417
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,500
Oh, that's nice.

418
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,750
Yep.

419
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,000
Save to Lab.

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,765

421
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,015
It's doing its magic.

422
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:29,100

423
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,750
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Here you go.

424
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,000
PAUL KINLAN: So we can
play it from there.

425
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,810

426
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,710
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: You can see
all the changes happening.

427
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,180
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, that's
really cool.

428
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,766
Oh, that's when I moved
it down as well.

429
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

430
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,830
PAUL KINLAN: That's
really nice.

431
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,280
And that, again, is just the
Canvas animation with Web

432
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Audio playing.

433
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,980
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

434
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,720
PAUL KINLAN: So I mean, a lot of
people kind of are worried

435
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,270
about starting to play with
Web Audio, and you know,

436
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,890
obviously, it's a
Chrome thing.

437
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,450
Well, it's Chrome and Safari
now, at least, anyway.

438
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,600
I mean, did you have any issues
with Web Audio itself?

439
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,940
It was relatively immature, I
think, when you guys started

440
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,370
the project.

441
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,130
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah, it's
was simply straightforward

442
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,080
from the beginning.

443
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,400
It's quite an easy thing
to get into.

444
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,730
You have samples that you want
to play, and you can add

445
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,170
effects, and you don't have
to code that much.

446
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,080
You can just take
the good things

447
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,570
and connect it together.

448
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,250
ROGER PALA: Less trouble than
the audio tag code.

449
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,580
PAUL KINLAN: Really?

450
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:25,990
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

451
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,890
ROGER PALA: Although it
seems easier to use.

452
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,840
It's not, at the
end of the day.

453
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,250
PAUL KINLAN: Nice.

454
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,630
Yeah, I think that's the first
thing that people naturally

455
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,660
gravitate towards, is the audio
tag, because you have a

456
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,300
dot play and dot pause,
essentially, which I always

457
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,460
thought should've been stopped,
but regardless.

458
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,620
ROGER PALA: Even in looping, for
example, on the audio tags

459
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,250
is quite tricky.

460
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,822
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

461
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,060
PAUL KINLAN: Right.

462
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,100
I really liked this.

463
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,590
I didn't actually realize that
you didn't physically record

464
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,985
the output.

465
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:54,670
So you just record the
events, essentially.

466
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,350
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

467
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,150
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

468
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,400
That's pretty cool.

469
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,810

470
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,090
My big thing about
this, I like the

471
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,330
collaborative aspect of it.

472
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,079
It's the one thing that
I find that is most

473
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,329
powerful about the web.

474
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,390
When you're trying to compare
native applications and web

475
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,300
applications is we tend on the
web to have always been

476
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,750
building collaborative-based
experiences.

477
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,760
We've found it a lot easier to
do that on native platforms.

478
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,770
I think this one really
kind of shows off a

479
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,290
lot really cool stuff.

480
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,540
And the fact is, I mean, when
we actually demoed this

481
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,210
before, we were practicing what
happened, and no one was

482
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,099
playing at the time.

483
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,410
We were kind of worried.

484
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,860
So we've got quite a few
people now playing from

485
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,060
Brazil, United States.

486
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,480
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And it's quite
interesting to see where

487
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
people are playing from.

488
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,500
Someone in Mexico sitting
there playing

489
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,400
the exact same time.

490
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,080
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

491
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,810
I wonder if they think
that I'm a

492
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,550
cool musician or something.

493
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,100
He's really good, this guy.

494
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
That's nice.

495
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,780
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And what you
can say about the virtual as

496
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,760
well, you see the latency
of WebSockets there.

497
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,550
Because in the one in the
museum, it's the delay of the

498
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,190
video to get that synced.

499
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,910
But for the virtual,
we don't have that.

500
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,270
So you see that when you drag
it, it kind of releases

501
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,120
directly, and it's been
traveling all the way to--

502
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,544
I think Las Vegas is where
our server is.

503
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:09,040
PAUL KINLAN: Wow.

504
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,420
That's pretty cool.

505
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,860
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

506
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,380
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty exciting.

507
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

508
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,050
PAUL KINLAN: I kind of--

509
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,120
yeah, I'm just amazed
at the level of

510
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,940
awesomeness that this--

511
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,880
I like all the projects.

512
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,900
I think this is my favorite
of the five experiments

513
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,040
altogether.

514
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,890
I like the fact that you can
just stream it through and see

515
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,740
what's happening
in the museum.

516
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,450
I remember the other day, I saw
someone actually fixing

517
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,450
the machine.

518
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,860
I was planning all the Hangouts
and everything, and I

519
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,400
was like, oh, there's someone
fixing the machine.

520
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,300
And they were just moving stuff
around a little bit, and

521
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,090
the whole thing was
just a nice--

522
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,356
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And you can
see people dance around the

523
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,150
instruments.

524
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,060
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

525
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,720
Yeah, that's pretty good.

526
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,380
The other thing is I like the
confluence of YouTube Live to

527
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,600
actually kind of handle
the scale of it.

528
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,570
Because I can imagine that
there's lots and lots of

529
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,930
people always on this page.

530
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,540
And then when you get to your
own instrument, well, you know

531
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,590
that you can deliver a direct
channel to the person then.

532
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,070
You don't need to scale
that out so much.

533
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,646
You need to make sure
it works, right?

534
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,870
But you don't need to check
too much on there.

535
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,140
It's pretty cool.

536
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,050
I like that.

537
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,340
It's good.

538
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,630
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

539
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,835
PAUL KINLAN: Congratulations.

540
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:18,280
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Thanks.

541
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,490
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

542
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,630
So I think that is the end of
this Hangout, at least.

543
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,535
If you'd like to learn more,
we're going to have some

544
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:25,785
articles on HTML5 Rocks.

545
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:27,950

546
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,760
These guys are going
to produce an

547
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,080
article on HTML5 Rocks.

548
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,210
If not--

549
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:32,892
[LAUGHTER]

550
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,660
PAUL KINLAN: See, this is--

551
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,710
so we're going to hopefully
try and do a bit more of a

552
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,530
technical deep dive.

553
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,800
This is obviously--

554
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,230
this sits in the middle of the
documentation on the site,

555
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,250
which is into how it works
and the kind of very more

556
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,600
technical information.

557
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,330
We're tried to give you like a
nice little middle ground of

558
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,960
showing you how the technologies
are used together

559
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,890
and how the guys built it.

560
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,990
So thank you very much, and
we'll see you soon.
