00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:06,430

2
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,080
PETE LEPAGE: Well, welcome
everybody.

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,990
My name's Pete LePage.

4
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,310
I'm a developer advocate
here at Google.

5
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,020
And with me today, we've got a
very special group of people

6
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,010
to talk about Movi.Kanti.Revo,
the new Chrome experiment in

7
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,900
conjunction with the team
at Cirque du Soleil.

8
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,510
With me, I've got a Nicole
McDonald, who was the creative

9
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,400
director on the project and
Gillian Ferrabee, who is a

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,800
creative director at
Cirque du Soleil.

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,610
Nicole, why don't you introduce
yourself first,

12
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,660
because you're up on screen.

13
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,290
And then we'll have Gillian
introduce herself.

14
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,790
NICOLE MCDONALD: Hi, I'm
Nicole McDonald.

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,770
It's a pleasure to
be with you.

16
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,126
I'm a creative director and
director specializing in

17
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:54,420
interactive directing.

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,670
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,040

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,130
Cool.

21
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,690
And Gillian, do you want
to introduce yourself?

22
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,310
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Yeah hi,
I'm Gillian Ferrabee.

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,540
I'm the creative director
at Cirque du Soleil.

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,190
My title is creative director
of images and special

25
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,064
projects, which is mostly
anything to do with TV, film,

26
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:11,100
and new media.

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,560
And this project would fall
under special projects.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,470
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,180
All right, well, cool.

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,190
So today, while we've got some
of these things going on, if

31
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,580
you guys have questions, things
that you want to ask of

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,160
folks, we've got a place where
you can ask questions at

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,170
goo.gl/5iDjh.

34
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,960
The URL is there on screen.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,090
So if you have questions, things
that you want to know a

36
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,640
little bit more about, feel
free to go and post your

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,670
questions there.

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,810
And we'll take your questions
as we get towards the end of

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,930
the session.

40
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,970
So with that, I want to take it
over to Nicole to start and

41
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,870
say, Nicole, when you started
thinking about this project,

42
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,650
where did your initial
inspiration

43
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,540
come from for this?

44
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,230
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, we
actually really researched

45
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,410
Cirque du Soleil, and the
brand, and also the live

46
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,840
shows, and we tried to figure
out where to bring the live

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,530
show into an interactive
space.

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,450
And one of the inspirations
was magic.

49
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,930
Magic is something that draws us
in, [INAUDIBLE] to the eye.

50
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,210
It's visceral.

51
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,880
There's emotion behind it, and
that's where we, kind of-- we

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,130
thought about magic.

53
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,920

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,470
Magic [INAUDIBLE].

55
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,100
PETE LEPAGE: So what about the
magic of Cirque du Soleil sort

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,340
of brought you to
that experience?

57
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,780
What were some of the things
that you thought about that

58
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,776
would translate well
to the web?

59
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,513
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, one of
the things that I think Cirque

60
00:03:57,513 --> 00:04:02,140
du Soleil does extremely,
extremely well is, it kind of

61
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,750
is a feast of sense.

62
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,630
It's so beautiful, there's so
many colors, there's so many

63
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,770
things going on.

64
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,900
It's just hyper,
hyper gorgeous.

65
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
[INAUDIBLE]

66
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,720
points, well, one of the points
that we wanted to be

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,340
careful of was that in a live
experience, we feel connected

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,630
in ways that we don't when
we sit behind a computer.

69
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,895
And so one of our wants was to
really figure out how we could

70
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:38,820
get closer to the action and
experience it, maybe, in that

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,670
same way we would with
a live event.

72
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,910
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

73
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,030
And Gillian, for you, as you
started to look at this

74
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,470
project and start thinking about
this project, where did

75
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,880
the inspiration come
from for you?

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,500

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,210
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think for
us, the first meetings we had,

78
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,840
the two things that came up as
themes in terms of bringing

79
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,230
Cirque du Soleil to the world
of the web was curiosity is

80
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,110
something that Cirque
creates for their

81
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,890
audience as a way to engage.

82
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,540
So as Nicole said, it's magical,
and you want to

83
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,723
understand what's behind that
magic or where that magic is

84
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,530
going to take you.

85
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,080
So that idea of still being
able stretch people's

86
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,195
imagination and initiate
curiosity, which would give

87
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:25,970
someone the desire, then, to
move forward and into the

88
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,180
experience, in the sense
of interactivity.

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,285
And the other thing that came
up for us is adventure.

90
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,650
Because the web gives this sense
that you can access the

91
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,180
whole world.

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,520
What's the edge of the map?

93
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,740
How far can you go?

94
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,850
And how wide can you reach?

95
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,210
So [INAUDIBLE] came up with
curiosity, in the sense of

96
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,670
magic, and adventure.

97
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,580
PETE LEPAGE: Cool I think, for
me, one of the really amazing

98
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,010
things about the web
is that we are

99
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,180
always pushing it forward.

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,670
Or we're always trying
to push it forward.

101
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,310
And that's certainly one of the
main components of Chrome

102
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,390
experiments is, like, we can
take the web here, and what we

103
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,770
do to push it to that
really neat thing?

104
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,710
And how do we make it do
something it's never seen

105
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,760
somebody do before?

106
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,700
Nicole, when you started working
on this, how did the

107
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,120
technology affect your
inspiration?

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,485
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, it's
actually going back to the

109
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,660
live shows.

110
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,730
Even though you're not
necessarily interacting, it is

111
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,740
still a 3D experience.

112
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,440
And one of the things that I
really wanted was to have it

113
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,530
be engaging in a
3D experience.

114
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,970
And so that's where we came up
with the idea that we were

115
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,440
using a 2D world
in a 3D space.

116
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,890
And so I think the technology
allowed us to really create a

117
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,360
layered environment.

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,890
And that, I think, started to
snowball into, how do you

119
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,520
create a layered environment?

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,040
What does it do?

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,210
How does it react?

122
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,680
Why does react?

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,400
And I think that's a good
question is, why?

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,386
Why use technology?

125
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:16,560
And it's really to tell
more of a story.

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,900
PETE LEPAGE: So you see
technology being a good way to

127
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,950
tell a better story and engage
with people in storytelling

128
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,185
and more dynamic experiences?

129
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,330
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, from
an artistic level, I think

130
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,870
technology is a paintbrush,
right?

131
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,330
So it's in size.

132
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,662
You can either use a fat
one, or you use a

133
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,270
smaller one for details.

134
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,880
I think that technology is
also just a way-- it's an

135
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,920
outlet to communicate ideas.

136
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,260
And the exciting thing about
it is, like you said, it's

137
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,410
never been done before.

138
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,066
But also, we can pull in people
to dream in ways that

139
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:53,960
they haven't before.

140
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,920
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

141
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,010
This is a question for
both of you guys.

142
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,440

143
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,770
Before you came to the web, or
before you started playing

144
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:11,680
with technology, what is your
creative experiences based on?

145
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,590
Did it come from painting,
drawing, or did it always

146
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,730
really exist around the web?

147
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,251

148
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:20,850
NICOLE MCDONALD: Gillian?

149
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,330
[LAUGHS].

150
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,906
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow.

151
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:26,110
Well, my personal history
goes way back.

152
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,740
I've been performing and making
art since as long as I

153
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:30,810
can remember.

154
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,380
My mother's a designer and an
artist and an educator.

155
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,650
But for me, it's been
mostly live and some

156
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,655
drawing, music, singing.

157
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:47,480
But the primary has been live
audience, traditional and

158
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,990
nontraditional stage.

159
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,700
PETE LEPAGE: OK

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,640
NICOLE MCDONALD: And for me,
my background has been

161
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,430
everything.

162
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,685
You know, wit Christmas every
year, I got a new art kit.

163
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:04,090

164
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,800
I was constantly a
little artist.

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,020
I started, actually, in college
as a performance and

166
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,770
filmmaking and painting.

167
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,020
[LAUGHS].

168
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,010

169
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,890
And then I immediately, after
college, went into games.

170
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,830
And I painted sets for games.

171
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,190
And that started my interest
in interactive.

172
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,490
And so I took this fine
art world and

173
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,900
started making it digital.

174
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,300
I was really quite lucky.

175
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,730
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

176
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,100
Gillian, when Nicole and the
crew first sat down with you

177
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,870
guys and said, hey, here's this
really cool experience

178
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,850
that we're thinking about doing,
and showed some of

179
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,310
their inspiration and mood
boards, what did you think of

180
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,050
what they were showing and where
they were going with

181
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,460
some of these things?

182
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,780
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Well, the
first thing that was, I think,

183
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,550
exceptional and almost magical,
really, to use the

184
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,720
word, was that we had prepared
a mood board, and there was

185
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,370
actually one image that we both
had chosen for our mood

186
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,330
board, of all that's possible
to find on the net.

187
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,900
So that was kind of
mind blowing.

188
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,230
When they presented their mood
board, we looked at each

189
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,150
other, like, we didn't give
that to them, did we?

190
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,730
No, we haven't talked
to each other.

191
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,970
So there was an immediate
complicity and common vision

192
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,190
that was obvious from that and
from a few other things.

193
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,580
And the other thing, from the
Cirque's point of view, that

194
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,910
was a strong indicator was--

195
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,200
I can't remember, I think was
Nicole, but somebody brought

196
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,460
up the idea of the screen, what
you might call the fourth

197
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,325
wall, and how to playfully
interact with your audience.

198
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,400
Like now, even, this is live,
we're talking-- how do you

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,730
interact through this new
form of communicator?

200
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,880
And that was something we were
definitely curious about.

201
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,660
So those were the two things
that pretty much nailed it.

202
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,443
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

203
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:02,570
Nicole, what were your feelings
on those first couple

204
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,130
of meetings, when you sat down
and said, this is what we're

205
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,060
thinking, going from a really
web and creative background to

206
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,985
a company who's all
about doing live,

207
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,950
in-person kind of stuff?

208
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,720
NICOLE MCDONALD: It was super,
super exciting, obviously, I

209
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,610
mean, I kind of a dream
come true, really.

210
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,570
To work with such a creative,
imaginative, really

211
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,830
responsible company, that's
kind of rare.

212
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:41,200
But I think the challenge of
it all was thrilling, to

213
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,930
really kind of crack open the
nut a little bit and be able

214
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,185
to do take a step into a
direction of interactive

215
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:52,990
performing is super exciting.

216
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,710
PETE LEPAGE: So as you started
working on some of this stuff

217
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,470
and sort of took the technology
with your vision,

218
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,750
how did the technology change
the way that you saw the

219
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,500
vision being done as you were
working through the project?

220
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,828
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, I think
I'm a developer's worst

221
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:19,165
nightmare in that [INAUDIBLE],
because I think I know enough

222
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:24,790
of what technology can do, I
know where we can push it.

223
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,550
I think that one of the
challenges for us, from a

224
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,850
development standpoint was,
could we get things in time?

225
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:38,110
Could different technologies be
available at that moment?

226
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,990
I think that was our
biggest challenge.

227
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,680
PETE LEPAGE: So whether and
when technology came on,

228
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,384
whether you had access to it?

229
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:52,090
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and I
think that usually the process

230
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,630
of how I work in an interactive
space is, we

231
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,840
dream, and then we kind
of dial it back.

232
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,570
And then we become detectives
and solve problems, which is,

233
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,380
I think, the best-case
scenario.

234
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,283
Solving problems means we move
forward, which is [INAUDIBLE].

235
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:14,460
PETE LEPAGE: Were there any
problems that you were really

236
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,640
proud of having solved with this
project, technology-wise,

237
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,880
creativity-wise?

238
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,670
NICOLE MCDONALD: That's a
really good question.

239
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,643
I think you'll notice that
there's an incredible amount

240
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:35,420
of layered sprites and divs,
figuring out what a system

241
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,280
could handle.

242
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,760
And you dream big and so you
have, like, seven videos

243
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,520
playing, and all these
animations, and then there are

244
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,610
all these huge files.

245
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,850
And then really figuring
out, OK, now we have--

246
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,858
it's not moving on a computer.

247
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,550
So nobody can watch it.

248
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,620
It looks great, but
nobody can see it.

249
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,360
Really figuring out what
that wait was.

250
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,765
So how do we turn this down, but
still, how do we maintain

251
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,950
our vision?

252
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,405
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

253
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:06,390
NICOLE MCDONALD: That was
definitely a big challenge.

254
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,640
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

255
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,290

256
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,980
What was it like going through
the process of saying, OK, so

257
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,200
we've got our idea here.

258
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,720
What did the workflow look like,
to say, all right, so

259
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,310
here's our idea, after those
first meetings with Cirque, to

260
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,132
then go and get to that
final project?

261
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:30,000
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, we took
some time and wrote the story.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
That was super fun, just
to tell the narrative.

263
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,570
And then once we had the
narrative, we actually made it

264
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,025
a functioning animatic And then
from the animatic, it

265
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:48,100
kind of gave us the answer of
flow and also an asset list,

266
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,390
which was super important.

267
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,410
PETE LEPAGE: For each of the
different scenes, yeah.

268
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,670
NICOLE MCDONALD: And
then we shot it.

269
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,280
And then at the shoot, we were
able to kind of pull in video

270
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,527
live and be able to see how it
moved and whether or not our

271
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,740
horizon line was correct, or
overshooting it, or even just

272
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,020
if it was a worthwhile
experience.

273
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,050
And then from there on,
it was just, go.

274
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,560
PETE LEPAGE: And Gillian, how
did you see, and how did your

275
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,140
team work with Nicole to really
take that vision from

276
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,390
beginning to end?

277
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,890

278
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,154
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think the
main thing was keeping in

279
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:36,000
touch all along the way so that
everybody had a sense of

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,150
what was happening, what
it looked like.

281
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,120
Did it match what we wanted
and imagined?

282
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,040

283
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,620
I can't think of any specific
obstacle, but I know that we

284
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,380
hit a bunch.

285
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,950
And Nicole probably
remembers this.

286
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,810
We would always say, well,
that's because something else

287
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,970
even better's going to
show up, which it

288
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,350
actually did, often.

289
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,850
The part that was most
interesting, for us, I would

290
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,430
say, was the actual shoot and
watching how the artists,

291
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:11,990
themselves, how Nicole was able
to translate to them what

292
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,400
their work was going to look
like in the final product.

293
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Because a live performer knows,
they're onstage when

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,370
it's happening.

295
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,330
So what they give comes
from that knowledge.

296
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,870
And so Nicole was able to inform
them the context that

297
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,980
they were performing in, what
it would look like, and then

298
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,610
they were able to play and adapt
with that, which was

299
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,900
exciting for us to see that.

300
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,760
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and
I think that's where the

301
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,270
animatic played an incredible
role, and also being able to

302
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,760
input stuff immediately live.

303
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,060
In a green screen environment,
it's cold.

304
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,980
There's no connection.

305
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,720
And I think that was super
exciting that we were able to

306
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,085
show the artists where they were
in the space and really

307
00:16:57,085 --> 00:17:01,272
let them have that world and
take over that world.

308
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:06,480
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, actually, I
just got some of the green

309
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,670
screen video set up so that we
can see have a quick peek at

310
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,599
that, I think.

311
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,700
Let me see if I can get
that running here.

312
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,450
There we go.

313
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,210
So we've got some picture in
picture going so that folks

314
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,900
can see what's going on there.

315
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,089
So this was the scene where
our guide jumps

316
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,569
backwards off the log.

317
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,350
And you can see her there
on that blue screen.

318
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,840
Nicole, as we run through that,
what was your process of

319
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,460
thinking through how to do these
things, because you see

320
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,890
just this blue screen.

321
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,470
And the artist has really no
idea, we have really no idea,

322
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,755
until we see what's going
on, what to expect.

323
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,340
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, what we
tried to do is to have some

324
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,270
key frames to show the artist
where they were in the space,

325
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,630
and also for us to be able
to plan appropriately.

326
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,790
This is an A-camera.

327
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,320
We don't have a B-camera to cut
to, so the entire scene is

328
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,100
first person POV.

329
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,710
So we really needed to make sure
that there was a thread

330
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,655
throughout-- like a breadcrumb
trail continuous, throughout

331
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,260
the experience.

332
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:25,220
And with these frames, we were
also able to build out the 3D

333
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,720
experience, and then immediately
key the video and

334
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,370
put them into an environment
to help the artist see what

335
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,220
space they were working
in, and to--

336
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,050

337
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,220
what was the first film of Star
Wars that came out, where

338
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,240
they used blue screen
everywhere?

339
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,810

340
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,020
PETE LEPAGE: The remakes,
or the--

341
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,586
NICOLE MCDONALD: The new ones.

342
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:53,400
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, yes.

343
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,150
NICOLE MCDONALD: I just remember
how cold that was.

344
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,770
There was no connection.

345
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,980
And there was just
these two people

346
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,230
speaking to one another.

347
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,480

348
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
We were joking and saying, we
do not want to create that.

349
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,040

350
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,250
PETE LEPAGE: Gillian, for you
guys, was this the first big

351
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,810
web project that you guys had
worked on at Cirque du Soleil?

352
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,685
Or how had you guys worked
with the web before?

353
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:21,380

354
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,280
GILLIAN FERRABEE: It was
the first creative

355
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,630
project, I would say.

356
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,880
Obviously Cirque has done lots
of marketing, and the company

357
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,385
website, and other, more
traditional, transitions to

358
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:34,860
the web, doing things that
people were doing anyway,

359
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,130
before the web, but in
a different way.

360
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,360
But this was the actual--

361
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,175
the content was created
for this project, and

362
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,690
it was fully creative.

363
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,160
[INAUDIBLE].

364
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,950
PETE LEPAGE: Were you somewhat
skeptical at the beginning, or

365
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,700
did you think that we would
be able to create such an

366
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:58,040
immersive, Cirque-like
experience right off the bat?

367
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,942
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I'm a highly
optimistic person, so I wasn't

368
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:03,407
skeptical, because I
almost never am.

369
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,790
But I would say there
were definitely lots

370
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,970
of people who were.

371
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,180
And the minute we met Nicole and
their team, that went out

372
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,860
the window.

373
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
Their enthusiasm--

374
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,750
and maybe they were as highly
optimistic, but they were the

375
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,180
experts, and they seemed really

376
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,080
excited that it was possible.

377
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,320
So that schooled us
pretty quickly.

378
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,570
PETE LEPAGE: That's
awesome, yeah.

379
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,200

380
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,540
How would you describe the
difference between working

381
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,980
with a web experience and
working with a live show,

382
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,304
starting something like that?

383
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,400
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow, that's
a good question.

384
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,650
It's completely different,
because, from the beginning,

385
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,120
your framework is
not a theater.

386
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,070
It's not an audience.

387
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,810
It's a platform, in a way.

388
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,480
It's a tool.

389
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,410
But there's much more unknown,
which can be exciting, except

390
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,540
that, when you're doing a show,
the parameters are very

391
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,080
concrete and practical.

392
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,760
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

393
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,940
GILLIAN FERRABEE:
Go ahead Nicole?

394
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,090
NICOLE MCDONALD: I was just
going to say, I think it's

395
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,336
practical because it's known.

396
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:16,951
Because we haven't defined the
process of interactive--

397
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:20,460
there is no cookie cutter
process, necessarily.

398
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,900
I think that that's the exciting
and the scary part.

399
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,580
GILLIAN FERRABEE:
It's definitely

400
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,415
exciting for Cirque.

401
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:32,120
And the first question we asked
ourselves is, what are

402
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,530
all the things that we can't do
in a live show because of

403
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,660
the parameters of time, or the
weight of something, or the

404
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,340
feasibility, visually?

405
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,890
The suspension of disbelief is
completely different live.

406
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,865
So it's a very exciting
terrain.

407
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:54,260

408
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,090
I mean, Cirque has always been
interested in the unknown, as

409
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,340
Nicole said.

410
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,530
PETE LEPAGE: So what were some
of the things that, right off

411
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,160
the bat, when you said, what are
the things we can't do a

412
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,220
live show, what were some of the
things that you said, we

413
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,510
can't do, could we do
these on the web?

414
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,650

415
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:16,730
GILLIAN FERRABEE: The first
thing that comes up is, in the

416
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,170
web, you have, to some
degree more say how

417
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,030
the story is told.

418
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,700
Because live, you don't
know where the

419
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,980
person's going to look.

420
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,040
Which Cirque is a real master
of giving people lots of

421
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,490
things to look at and, in a way,
guiding their attention.

422
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,000

423
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,170
So that's different.

424
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,750
On the web, it gives more
of a traditional

425
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,240
storytelling process.

426
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,690
And the other thing
is practical--

427
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,580
like, to get something onto
stage takes time.

428
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,650
And to get it off takes time.

429
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,690
And when you're shooting, you
can do that before you turn

430
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,560
the camera on for however
long it takes.

431
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,540
So that's a very practical and
very creative examples.

432
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,950
PETE LEPAGE: Were there any
things in the Movi.Kanti.Revo

433
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,760
experience that you pushed
to have them try

434
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,010
some of those things?

435
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,720

436
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,682
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Nothing
comes to mind because my

437
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:22,530
experience is that Nicole
and [INAUDIBLE]

438
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,710
surprised us over and over.

439
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,270
We didn't have time
to catch up.

440
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,990

441
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,970
NICOLE MCDONALD: From our
perspective, I think it was

442
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,650
about, really, how to challenge
this experience of

443
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,940
intimate, a one-on-one
experience, whereas in the

444
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,260
theater, there's many, many
people around you.

445
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,740
So how do I engage somebody in
the one-on-one experience?

446
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,890
And then also perspective--

447
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,990
we can gauge perspective
behind a computer.

448
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,580
In a theater, you're
in a seat.

449
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,220
[INAUDIBLE]

450
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,140
that Cirque does an amazing
job doing many shows, like

451
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,040
you're moving around the space
as much as they're moving

452
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,430
around you.

453
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,200
But I think that's a really
super interesting thing for

454
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,570
how to translate live experience
in the future is,

455
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,750
it's a virtual theater seat.

456
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,200
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah actually,
that's a perfect segue into

457
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,263
the next question I have, which
is, what do you think

458
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:26,240
that the web brings to
experiences that you can't do

459
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,960
in a live show?

460
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,030
And where do you see that going
and changing the way

461
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,840
some, not just Cirque shows, but
in all live entertainment

462
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,668
changes in the future?

463
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:46,530
NICOLE MCDONALD: That's
a very good--

464
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,370
I mean, I don't really think we
know quite yet until we do.

465
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,900
Because I think the wonderful
part of about doing stories

466
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,480
interactively is that every
single time, we find out

467
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,650
something new about a way to
engage somebody differently.

468
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:08,650
And that's, I think, the part
of the process that is the

469
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,280
most challenging, because
it's almost like--

470
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,980
and I think this is why my
developers kind of hate me

471
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,480
sometimes-- not hate me,
but obviously, raise

472
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,560
their fist to me--

473
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,870
is because I think I'm
constantly using technology in

474
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,080
ways that it's not supposed
to be used.

475
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,190
And that's how we
move forward.

476
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,790
That's how we push the lines.

477
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,970
PETE LEPAGE: I think one of the
things that really excites

478
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,510
me with the web is, it's
not always about--

479
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,690
the technology is not supposed
to used this way.

480
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,450
It's that as browser vendors, or
as the people who make the

481
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,070
specifications develop stuff,
they say, hey, we think it's

482
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,310
going to get used this way.

483
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,180
But then creative, brilliant
people like you guys come in

484
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,030
and say, oh, hey, if I
do this and this, I

485
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,840
can get this to happen.

486
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,530
And suddenly you get something
that's never really been seen

487
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,630
or done before.

488
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,690
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, it's
like using a hammer for

489
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,495
something else other
than nailing.

490
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:14,600

491
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,520
If there's a tool available,
then it can kind of push us

492
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,150
into ways that we don't
reveal yet.

493
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,100
GILLIAN FERRABEE: One other
thing that comes to mind from

494
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,840
a live [? performance ?]

495
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,230
point of view is there is a
different kind of intimacy.

496
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,990
As Nicole was saying, you can
move the camera into places

497
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,250
that you can't always
see from your seat.

498
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,730
And then the other thing that's
way out there is the

499
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,040
web provides a different kind
of live, which is--

500
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,580
for instance, in the way that
if you're using an app,

501
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,250
sometimes you can see who else
is using it at that moment.

502
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,250
There's a collective
participation over time and

503
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,130
space that you never have with
the limitations of 1,200

504
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,920
people from 8:00 to 10:30 or any
form of live experience.

505
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,600
There's that potential for
a different kind of live.

506
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,950
NICOLE MCDONALD: And a very
new and exciting unity.

507
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,980

508
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,100
There's people that are coming
together that would never have

509
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,930
the opportunity to
come together.

510
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,560
It's incredibly exciting.

511
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,380
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

512
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,370
Well, let's talk about the
workflow, a little bit, of

513
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,330
taking some of the actual
practical things and putting

514
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,150
them onto the web into some
of those experiences.

515
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,820
So Nicole, as you started going
through and saying, OK,

516
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,690
this is what I want some of
these scenes to look like, how

517
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,040
did you say--

518
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,830
for example, the tree
of life scene--

519
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,040
how did you translate that from
being something in your

520
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,310
head to being something very,
like, touch, like, I can go

521
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,575
and see that, I can
move around?

522
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:59,340

523
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,580
NICOLE MCDONALD: I think it's
that this is about sketching.

524
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,155
We sketched the tree out.

525
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:09,280
I kind of [? drew ?] the layout,
originally, handed it

526
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,500
to some very talented artists,
who painted it.

527
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,490
PETE LEPAGE: Now, when you say
painted it, because we've got

528
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,670
a lot of different types of
folks who are watching this--

529
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,070
some may be a little bit more
like me, who are more

530
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,980
developer oriented.

531
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,440
And for me, I know how to
write some angle bracket

532
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,460
markup-y like stuff, but
anything more than that, I

533
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,330
need your help.

534
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,570
So what's painting it mean, and
how do you go about that?

535
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,910
NICOLE MCDONALD: Well, I really
wanted the experience

536
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,180
to be very set designed, but
also touched by humans.

537
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,660
So we actually literally
created paintbrushes in

538
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,460
Photoshop, and if you zoom into
some of the [INAUDIBLE]

539
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,050
the pieces, you'll actually see
the actual paint brushes

540
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:01,660
of the artist that digitally
painted, in Photoshop, each of

541
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:07,750
the elements that we created.

542
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,950
Because we wanted it to feel,
actually, a bit of Renaissance

543
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,200
[INAUDIBLE].

544
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,970

545
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,560
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

546
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,570
I think you broke up there at
the last little second, but I

547
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,340
think you were saying
Renaissance paintings, and

548
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,370
each one was hand drawn.

549
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,570
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah,
I'm breaking up.

550
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,520
PETE LEPAGE: All right, well,
hopefully this will clear up

551
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,770
here in a second.

552
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,430

553
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,620
So from the point where you
started taking each thing, and

554
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,480
turned each painting--

555
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,710
designed each scene in
Photoshop, where did it go

556
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,240
from there?

557
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,150
So you've got this great PSD
file that's potentially pretty

558
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,000
huge, and you can't just hand
that over to a developer.

559
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,250
So what happened next?

560
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:58,230

561
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,760
NICOLE MCDONALD: Then we
had this huge PSD, and

562
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,220
we pulled it apart.

563
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,330

564
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,230
Can you hear me, OK?

565
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,480
PETE LEPAGE: I can now.

566
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,200

567
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,470
All right, looks like we've
lost you here for a sec.

568
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,190

569
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,030
Let's see, Gillian, why don't
we pop over to you for a sec

570
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,140
and give it a sec for
Nicole's network

571
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,970
connection to come back.

572
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,460
What was your favorite scene
in this project?

573
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,150
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow.

574
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,260
I sincerely love them all
for different reasons.

575
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,960
They have different energies
and different flavor.

576
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,585

577
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:46,690
I mean, the tree of life
was the one that

578
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,760
surprised me the most--

579
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,110
how moving it was, how effective
and how moving, when

580
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,690
he floats up at the end,
I was completely

581
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,690
surprised the first time.

582
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,298
And then I really loved when the
user arrives at the fork

583
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,850
in the road in the forest,
because it was just

584
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,370
delightful.

585
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,970
The delight of this little
tricycle coming and then the

586
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,020
clown, and how that all works
so beautifully, the same way

587
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,135
it would've onstage, those are
the ones that I remember at

588
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,480
this moment the most.

589
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,970
PETE LEPAGE: Cool Nicole,
do we have you back?

590
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,690

591
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,720
No, looks like no Nicole yet.

592
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,310

593
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,940
All right, well, I've got to
say, I think my favorite scene

594
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,440
was tree of life, as well.

595
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,770
There was just something
absolutely beautiful about it

596
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,000
that really said--

597
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,420
between the growth of
everything, between the way

598
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,920
that you can go in and see all
of the different things

599
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,340
interacting and moving together,
it's just such a

600
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,100
beautiful thing.

601
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,810
And in some ways, I think
that scene is kind of

602
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,140
a little bit sad.

603
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,040
But it's also just so--

604
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,560
I feel like, it's a great big
circle, which is kind of fun,

605
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,840
something that you don't
typically see around

606
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,350
in stuff like that.

607
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,326
All right, it looks like
we've got Nicole back.

608
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:14,020
NICOLE MCDONALD: Sorry guys.

609
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,810
PETE LEPAGE: That's OK.

610
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,840
And it looks beautifully nice
and sunny there now.

611
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,344
I'm jealous.

612
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:21,190
Cool.

613
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,910
Well, Nicole, we were talking
about taking that gigantic PSD

614
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,630
and turning it into something
that, as a developer, I could

615
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,010
go do something with.

616
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,040
Do you want to talk about
that a little bit more?

617
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,480
NICOLE MCDONALD: Sure.

618
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,800
So the PSD, one of things,
[INAUDIBLE] that we had to

619
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,430
kind of creative a layered PSD
that was appropriate for the

620
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,260
space in which we were
putting it in.

621
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,450
So in other words, if we had
some trees, if there's trees

622
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,990
behind them, those trees behind
had to be painted.

623
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,680
So in Photoshop, this huge,
layered file then got cut into

624
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,930
transparent [INAUDIBLE]

625
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,790
and optimized.

626
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,880
And then we brought them into
the 3D space in HTML5.

627
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,710
And that was kind of it.

628
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:19,466
It was pretty long term in the
effort it took it to create,

629
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:22,570
but once it was created,
it was executed fast.

630
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,530
PETE LEPAGE: Very cool.

631
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,500
And just as a reminder for those
folks who are watching

632
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,630
live right now, we do have a
place where you can go ask

633
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,920
questions if you have questions

634
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,610
for Gillian or Nicole.

635
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,470
You can post your questions
there, and we'll take some of

636
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,700
those as we get towards the
end of the session.

637
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,020
But the URL is up on
screen right now.

638
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,190
Nicole, I had asked Gillian what
her favorite scene was.

639
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,090
What's your favorite scene
in the experience?

640
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,340
NICOLE MCDONALD: That's
a good question.

641
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,030

642
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,000
I think probably, the
tree of life.

643
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,880
I think the barge performance,
I think, is really lovely.

644
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,580
PETE LEPAGE: Which one was the
barge performance again?

645
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,600
NICOLE MCDONALD: The one with
the clown pulling the house,

646
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,620
and then the girls coming out
and dancing and performing.

647
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,567
I loved the fork in the road.

648
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:19,139
I like a lot of them.

649
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,254
PETE LEPAGE: Which one do you
think you're most proud of?

650
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:23,989
NICOLE MCDONALD: I think
the tree of life.

651
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:27,210
I feel like that was the
closest to what I had

652
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,460
envisioned.

653
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,090

654
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,210
The clown is just--

655
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,765
the fool in love is
so beautiful.

656
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:35,370

657
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,139
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah it's pretty
pretty is slightly awkward to

658
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,710
say, but very true.

659
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,260
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think what
people love about that is that

660
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,239
the poetry translates.

661
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,820
It's a very poetic
representation of something.

662
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,193
And everyone I've spoken
to got it.

663
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:59,180
They got the metaphor, and they
understood and were very

664
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,060
moved at the end,
when he floats.

665
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,750
So that's what struck me, is
how, again, this concept of

666
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,460
the web, and a screen, and how
such a depth of human poetry

667
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,070
can translate.

668
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,990
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah.

669
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,390
That was for my grandfather,
actually.

670
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,484

671
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:19,003
He's very connected
with family.

672
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:21,050
He's just madly in
love with family.

673
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,252
So I thought that was a nice
homage to my grandfather.

674
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:25,240
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Wow.

675
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,490
PETE LEPAGE: Wow, that's
kind of neat.

676
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,780

677
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,590
Gillian, how do think Cirque's
going to approach the web

678
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:39,470
differently because of this
experiment and the way that

679
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,760
people have been responding
to it?

680
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,100

681
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,590
GILLIAN FERRABEE: How are we
going to respond differently?

682
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,300
We're just really excited.

683
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,100
It was a delight from
beginning to

684
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,780
end, the whole process.

685
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,200
And people have responded
beyond our expectations,

686
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,050
in-house and everybody
outside.

687
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,330
So that only creates the
appetite to continue.

688
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,370
That's basically what--in the
big picture, there's lots of

689
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,690
excitement around it and lots of
interest and ideas and just

690
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,220
general excitement.

691
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,040
PETE LEPAGE: That's
really cool.

692
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,330
And it's so neat to see this
kind of stuff really whetting

693
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,080
the appetite.

694
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,310
One of the things that I hope
comes out of this and other

695
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,730
Chrome experiments is really to
get other developers, other

696
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,560
creatives excited, that they
can go do things on the web

697
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,390
that they've never seen
done before, right?

698
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,120
We've never seen a 3D world like
this built where you can

699
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,500
change the angles and interact
with it in such different and

700
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,640
neat ways until now.

701
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,030
And this really has said,
hey, look, we can

702
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,770
do something neat.

703
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,070
Why don't you go
try something?

704
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:01,370

705
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,940
In terms of the workflow, as you
started building this, to

706
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,950
jump back to that kind of stuff,
Gillian, how did you

707
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,240
see the workflow happening in
terms of working with a

708
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,640
company who wasn't necessarily
Cirque developers, and Cirque

709
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,280
designers, and Cirque people?

710
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,130

711
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,380
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Well again,
it was all new,

712
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,050
I think, for us.

713
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,870
I don't know for
Nicole's team.

714
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,200
I would say Nicole's experience
with a diverse

715
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,420
background, having done film,
having done live performance,

716
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,220
meant that she knew how
to speak to us.

717
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,980
I think that facilitated
a lot.

718
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,710
And it was really the ongoing
sharing of just where

719
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,706
everybody was at, and a lot
of visual referencing.

720
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:53,850
And then the big chunk
was the actual

721
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,180
shoot itself, obviously.

722
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,020
That was, I would say, the peak
of the collaborative part

723
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,270
on a day-to-day basis.

724
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,480

725
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,580
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

726
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,020
Well, we're getting a little
bit close to the end.

727
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,420
I want to take a look at some
of the questions that we've

728
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,260
got from some folks who are
posting their questions.

729
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,090
So one of the questions that
we've got is, where do you

730
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:25,560
think the web is going to be
with Cirque in 10 years?

731
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,020
And this is, I guess, for both
of you, because I think this

732
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,550
kind of interesting for both
of you guys to take.

733
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,460
And I'm going to tack on a
little bit of an extra

734
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,810
sentence on there--

735
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,590
not just Cirque, but

736
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,250
performances and art in general.

737
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,900

738
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:53,550
NICOLE MCDONALD: My hope is that
it's an experience that

739
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,360
we're participants in.

740
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,380
I think that we've come close
to being able to be

741
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,470
engaged on the web.

742
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,710
I would love to see performance,
especially on the

743
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,937
web, become about me feeling
connected in ways that I

744
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:12,840
haven't before.

745
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,870
And whether that's with touch
and call and response, meaning

746
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,840
if I touch somebody, do they
have goosebumps, suddenly?

747
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,710
If I touch them hard,
do they get bruised?

748
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,100
I think that's where
we're going.

749
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,910
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

750
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:38,190
So new interactions and better
ways to touch the audience.

751
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,990
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and
the audience is suddenly

752
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,730
participants.

753
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,580
And it's kind of dictated by
their own personal experience

754
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,080
and desire.

755
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,240
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

756
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,550
Gillian, what are
your thoughts?

757
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,310
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I mean, 10
years is a long way, in terms

758
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,640
of technology, to ever imagine
what's going to have happened.

759
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,970
I think the two most exciting
things-- the first is, kind of

760
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,610
what Nicole was saying, but
I would say around the

761
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,816
refinement and sophistication of
kinesthetic interactivity.

762
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:16,690
So that's something that Cirque
thinks about a lot,

763
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,700
which would allow for the user,
which is what we call

764
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,220
the name for the person now,
whereas we had a conversation

765
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,640
about it recently where, it
could go so fast, or there

766
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,080
could be so many dimensions that
it's not longer the user

767
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,230
and the web, but there's going
to be a whole sense of

768
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,960
possibilities of the user being
part of the art, and

769
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,330
influencing the art, and then
the art responding to that,

770
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,220
and there being so many
possibilities in

771
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,870
that that it really--

772
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,130
the line becomes more
and more blurred.

773
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,180
And then the other one is, I
think Nicole mentioned it

774
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,760
earlier, what the web provides
in terms of the opportunity

775
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,360
for people to find each other
that have more and more

776
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,380
specific things in common, and
how that's going to affect

777
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,630
art, per se.

778
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,180

779
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,590
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
an interesting idea.

780
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:15,060
So one of the questions that I
had, that I wanted to sort of

781
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,860
continue on with some of the
things we were talking about

782
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,360
earlier, is, how do you guys
want to see technology change

783
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,540
in the near term, so like in the
next couple of months, to

784
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,630
make these experiences better
or more interactive?

785
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,650

786
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,250
NICOLE MCDONALD: Technology
physically?

787
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,440
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

788
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,050
NICOLE MCDONALD: Alpha channel
video in WebM.

789
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,860

790
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,290
PETE LEPAGE: Why don't you talk
a little bit about why

791
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,120
you want that?

792
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,370
Because I know that was
something we were trying to

793
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,170
get in, and unfortunately
we didn't get it in

794
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,150
in time into Chrome.

795
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,750
It's coming soon
but not quite.

796
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,900
NICOLE MCDONALD: It's actually
something I've wanted, about,

797
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,830
for two years now.

798
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,650
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

799
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:08,670
NICOLE MCDONALD: Because you
have more control of changing

800
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,700
the way a video or
an experience is.

801
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,030

802
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,620
Let me think for a second.

803
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,140
So if I have an alpha channel
video, and my videos are on

804
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,560
rails, meaning I have a
narrative that is moving from

805
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,920
A to B, I have no ability to
switch those rails and have

806
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,940
the content or narrative
change quickly.

807
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:40,070
With alpha channel video, we can
have a much more reactive

808
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,220
environment for the user in
the narrative meaning.

809
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,750

810
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:51,940
And I have hope that that's
something that we have a

811
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,320
little bit more control over in
the future, is that we can

812
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,290
kind of change the narrative on
the fly, depending on what

813
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,200
user is reactive to.

814
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,610
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah and in
Movi.Kanti.Revo we kind of did

815
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,770
that at one point, where there's
the fork in the road

816
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,180
scene where the user can choose
which direction to go.

817
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:17,850
But it's a very limited amount
of changing on the fly.

818
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:23,210
NICOLE MCDONALD: Right, and if
you had a WebM alpha, the

819
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,420
possibilities of A or B, becomes
A to Z, which, I think

820
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,640
would be exciting.

821
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,020
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

822
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,270
And Gillian, what about you?

823
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,860

824
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,105
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I don't
have the same tech

825
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:40,970
knowledge of lingo.

826
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:44,510
But two things that come to mind
for me, it's simply that

827
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,670
people think about interactivity
as a full-bodied

828
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,240
experience.

829
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,830
Obviously, being a dancer from
Cirque, that's the first thing

830
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,430
that comes to mind.

831
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,730
Anything to facilitate, and
encourage, and play with

832
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,400
people using their whole body,
not just hands and eyes.

833
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,350
And the other thing is the
context and the environment.

834
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,680
I love the idea of anything
where the screen

835
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,565
is somewhere different.

836
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:17,360
It's on the street, it's on the
floor, the screen comes to

837
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,450
me more in my world than
just at my computer.

838
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:26,600
I think that as a 3D dancer
person, that's what I'm

839
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
looking for.

840
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,330
PETE LEPAGE: I think that's a
really powerful piece, that we

841
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,150
are interacting with more and
more screens every day,

842
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,840
whether you're talking about
your smartphone, whether

843
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,150
you're talking about your
laptop, your desktop, maybe

844
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,990
it's a tablet that you're
walking around with.

845
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,010
There are just so many different
screens that

846
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,485
we have access to.

847
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:50,180
And seeing these experiences
on more and more of these

848
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,410
scenes, I think, is phenomenally
powerful and a

849
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,410
really cool, fun thing to
see the web change.

850
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,100
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I think It
opens up the possibility for

851
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,590
surprise, which is one of the
best things in life and also

852
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:09,430
neat in that we all all live
in worlds, often, that are

853
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,110
very busy, and very repetitive,
and where we have

854
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,620
physical routines in
our life every day.

855
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:22,130
So the idea that a screen can
play the part of a magical

856
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:27,400
moment, the way flash mobs work,
dance mobs, where at the

857
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,060
beginning, you're going to work,
and you're going through

858
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,870
central station as you do every
morning, and then, ahh,

859
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,170
people start dancing.

860
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,940
So how can screens or the
capacity for screens to be in

861
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,510
new places begin to
provide that?

862
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,800
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, and how
do we show something new, and

863
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,820
exciting, and different to
people who wouldn't have

864
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,260
access to new and
exciting things?

865
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,566
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

866
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:59,880
Well, so I want to wrap up with
one question for both of

867
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,060
you guys to answer.

868
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,870
And it's really about, if you
could say to other designers

869
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,870
and creative folks, after having
worked through this

870
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,190
project, what would
you say to them?

871
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,320
How would you encourage them
to go and play with this?

872
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,860
Or what would you say?

873
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:21,880

874
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,500
NICOLE MCDONALD: To--
playing with Movi?

875
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,080
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

876
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,450
NICOLE MCDONALD: I would love
for people to go and see it,

877
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,250
and experience it, and be
excited by it, but also to

878
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,700
help us move forward
with technology.

879
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,890
And how would they do
it differently?

880
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:45,880
What would they do to make the
story have more depth or add

881
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,260
more creativity to it?

882
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,070
And then go do it so that we
kind of keep leapfrogging and

883
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:55,330
progressing, and inspiring
each other.

884
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,240
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

885
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,010
And Gillian, what are your
thoughts on that?

886
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,580
GILLIAN FERRABEE: My thoughts
are to encourage other

887
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,810
physically creative people--
so that would mean anyone

888
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:08,590
whose art form is
their own body--

889
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:13,080
to being playing with people
whose art form is technology.

890
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:21,840
Because I was so surprised,
with this project, how

891
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,580
visceral my response to the
artists was, how much I could

892
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,610
really feel them, and their
personalities, and their

893
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,200
charisma, and what they
were emanating.

894
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,490
So I think that's really
encouraging for people who are

895
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,360
physical performers, to know
that when you partner with the

896
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,890
right artist of technology,
they're as excited as you to

897
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,140
have that happen.

898
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,480
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

899
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,660
So we just actually had one
question pop in on the

900
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,330
question list that I
think is actually

901
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,140
a really neat question.

902
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:59,330
And the answer I'll give
immediately is, not right now,

903
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,210
but I'm curious what
you guys think.

904
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,000
Is there any possibility of
Movi.Kanti.Revo being

905
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,040
implemented on Google Glass and
this virtual space being

906
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,800
overlaid in the real world?

907
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,230
How do you guys see that
actually happening?

908
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,890
Because--

909
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,140
NICOLE MCDONALD: [INAUDIBLE].

910
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,062

911
00:48:21,062 --> 00:48:22,750
We have actually talked
about it.

912
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:28,700
And we have some ideas on how to
make this almost, kind of,

913
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,230
be an interactive flash mob.

914
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,540
PETE LEPAGE: Oh neat.

915
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,910
NICOLE MCDONALD: Yeah, we
potentially could be putting

916
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:43,370
it in places that surprise
us and draw us in.

917
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,855
PETE LEPAGE: Gillian, are you
familiar with Google Glass?

918
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,070
GILLIAN FERRABEE: No.

919
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:50,830
PETE LEPAGE: Google Glass is
a project that Google has

920
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,480
started working on.

921
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,320
It's a research project for the
most part right now, but

922
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,090
effectively what it is is it's
a pair of glasses that you

923
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,410
wear that have a little
display right here.

924
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,680
And you can interact with
it in all kinds

925
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,800
of different ways.

926
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,690
So the video that they showed
was showing being able to get

927
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,970
maps, but being able to send
messages, call people, talk to

928
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:18,240
people, because you have that
display right there in your

929
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,950
field of view, or maybe it's a
little bit above, or something

930
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:22,700
to that effect.

931
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,660
But you've always got that
technology right

932
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,910
there around you.

933
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,320

934
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:29,962
GILLIAN FERRABEE: I
had heard of it.

935
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:30,790
I didn't know what
it was called.

936
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,440
PETE LEPAGE: OK, so
for something like

937
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,680
Movi.Kanti.Revo, how do you see
that, maybe, playing into

938
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,920
something like this?

939
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,700
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Well, what
comes to mind first is the

940
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,420
obvious one, of the characters
being a part of your daily

941
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,920
life, and making even more
practical uses playful.

942
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,190
So if it's a map, as happened in
the forest, that they could

943
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:59,190
playfully feed you
the information.

944
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,790
And the other thing that
comes to mind is just--

945
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,570

946
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,816
my memory is that, in our brain,
80% of our receptors

947
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:09,140
are visual, and it affects our
whole body and our brains in

948
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,050
ways that we're just
learning about now.

949
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,860
So I think there's possibilities
beyond that that

950
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,805
the biological science
is going to

951
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,310
meet us on that front.

952
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,490
Who knows what it would do to
your body to think you were in

953
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:25,310
a forest when you
are in a city.

954
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,890
And if the forest is peopled
with fun, magical people,

955
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:34,010
would your whole body relax?

956
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,820
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

957
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,430
It would be interesting to take
that same technology and

958
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,850
concept and go the other way.

959
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,580
So put those on people at a
Cirque show, where you can

960
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:52,750
take the just amazing magic of
a Cirque show and augment it

961
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:58,240
even more by providing things
that change for each person.

962
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,210

963
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,150
That's really cool.

964
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,760
Well, I think that that's pretty
much about all the time

965
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,420
we have left for today.

966
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,870
I want to thank both of you guys
for joining us, Nicole,

967
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,530
for joining us from bright and
sunny LA and Gillian for

968
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,040
joining us from Montreal.

969
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,750
This has been really great, and
I think this experiment

970
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,800
has been fantastic.

971
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,800
You guys both did an absolutely
wonderful job.

972
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,260
It's been amazing to see people
respond to this and

973
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:33,648
really just sort of react
and love it as well.

974
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:34,860
NICOLE MCDONALD: Thank you.

975
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,110
PETE LEPAGE: With that, I want
to say thank you for joining

976
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,920
us, and thank you for helping
make this project

977
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,692
a phenomenal success.

978
00:51:41,692 --> 00:51:42,870
NICOLE MCDONALD: Thank you!

979
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,810
GILLIAN FERRABEE: Thanks
for having us.

980
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,040
PETE LEPAGE: Thanks, guys.

981
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,290
All right.

982
00:51:46,290 --> 00:52:15,200
