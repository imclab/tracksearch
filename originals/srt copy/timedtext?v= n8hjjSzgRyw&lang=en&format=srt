1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,167
Wilson: Okay, so I think we're
gonna go ahead and get going.

2
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:09,167
People are still sort of
filtering in from lunch,

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:11,000
but that's cool.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,834
So welcome. Good afternoon.
I hope you all had a good lunch.

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,501
Um, I'm Chris Wilson.
This is my colleague Dan Lee,

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,501
and we're here to talk with you

7
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:21,501
about building Web Apps
for Google TV.

8
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:25,501
And, um, if you want to tweet
about this--this presentation,

9
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:29,000
this session, our, um, hash tag
is on every slide,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,501
so handy reference.

11
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,834
You don't need to remember it
up front. It's #gtvweb.

12
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:34,501
I'm gonna resist the temptation

13
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,501
to actually watch Twitter
while I'm talking,

14
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,868
but, um, you can queue up
questions for the end.

15
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:42,834
So before we really get going,

16
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,834
I want to cover why television
is even interesting,

17
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,834
like, why we should care
about television.

18
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,834
It's kind of old media.

19
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,000
Probably a lot of you
in this room, um,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,834
may not even have a TV.

21
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,501
I know a number of friends
who don't have a TV anymore.

22
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,167
But, you know,
we do have the Web.

23
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,167
But the interesting fact

24
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:05,167
is that TV is actually
really, really popular.

25
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,167
Um, more American households

26
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,000
have TVs than cell phones
or computers.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,801
Computers--they're about--

28
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,067
80% of American households
have computers,

29
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:17,934
and, uh, about 90% of American
households have cell phones,

30
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,167
some form of mobile device,

31
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:23,934
and 99% of American households
have at least 1 TV.

32
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,934
In fact, more than,

33
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,934
uh, more than half
of those households

34
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,601
have three or more TVs.

35
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,601
That's a whole lot
of surface area

36
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,734
and a whole lot of, uh,

37
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:36,000
a whole lot of screens
for applications to be on.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,501
Worldwide, of course, numbers
are a little bit different,

39
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:40,934
but worldwide three-quarters
of all households

40
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,501
have TVs in them.

41
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,934
So even, you know, third world
nations and everything,

42
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:48,501
three-quarters of everyone
has a TV in their home.

43
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,834
In addition to that,

44
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,501
you know, that's kind of
all TVs, right?

45
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,534
That's every kind of old
NTSC TV, PAL TV, whatever.

46
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,834
What we're really talking
about here, of course,

47
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:02,167
is internet-capable
or "smart" TVs.

48
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,501
And there are not,
relatively speaking,

49
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,501
tons of these out there today.

50
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,667
There are about 2 million in
the U.S., um, as of last year.

51
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,000
But by 2014, it's expected

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,701
that more than a third
of all U.S. households

53
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,834
will have
an internet-connected TV in it,

54
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,834
uh, 43 million.

55
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,000
So you can see
the growth curve on this

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,734
has to be pretty astronomical
to get up that high.

57
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:28,167
In addition to that,

58
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:32,167
TV is actually used
more than any other media.

59
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,834
Um, in fact, in today,

60
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,501
uh, Americans spend more time
watching TV

61
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:41,167
than computer use and listening
to music put together.

62
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,501
And this is among
8 to 18 year olds, right?

63
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,501
This is among young kids,
teenagers,

64
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:48,834
the ones you would expect would
actually not be so focused on TV

65
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,501
and would be more focused
on listening to music

66
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:54,000
or using the computer to chat
with their friends or whatever.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,801
They're actually
still watching TV

68
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,801
more than both of those
put together.

69
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,467
In fact, they--they watch TV

70
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:04,200
more than three times as much
as they use a computer.

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,834
So to sum up,

72
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,167
TVs are more common
than computers.

73
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,501
Americans actually spend
more time watching TV

74
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,667
than any other activity,

75
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,667
so we kind of ought to make
better use of this time.

76
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:20,334
Now that sounds like I'm saying
"stop watching TV."

77
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,834
Um, that's not
actually my point, obviously.

78
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,167
What I'm really saying is
there's a lot of opportunities

79
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,267
to make that
TV experience better,

80
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:30,334
and that's really what
we want to talk about today,

81
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:34,167
and that's really what sparked
the Google TV project, in fact.

82
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,834
The ideas behind Google TV
were really pretty simple.

83
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,167
First of all,
we can take live TV,

84
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,167
the regular TV experience,
and make it a lot better.

85
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,834
We can apply search to it,

86
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,334
since obviously, Google knows
a little bit about search.

87
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,334
We can give live info
on what's on,

88
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:51,501
so that we can help you find
stuff that you want to watch

89
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:54,167
rather than you having to sit
there with your cable remote

90
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,334
flipping through 500 channels,

91
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,501
hoping to find
something interesting.

92
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:01,334
Secondly, there's a lot
of great Web content

93
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:03,501
out there already on the Web,

94
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,601
and it's kind of silly

95
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:08,000
to watch all of these videos
and--and other content

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
in a little 6-inch window
on your 13-inch laptop

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,167
when you've got the biggest
screen in the house

98
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,400
probably staring at you
in your living room,

99
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
and you probably have

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,801
the best sound system in your
house attached to it, as well.

101
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,801
Statistically speaking,
that's usually true.

102
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:25,667
You have the best speaker system
attached to your TV system.

103
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,167
Now there are 2 billion videos

104
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,667
watched every day
on YouTube alone.

105
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,501
Um, there are 35 hours of video

106
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,834
uploaded to YouTube
every minute.

107
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:40,167
So this actually outstrips
what you can watch live

108
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,501
by about 2,100 times.

109
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,834
So, um, they can't all
be funny cat videos.

110
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,801
There should be enough
to keep you busy.

111
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,501
So there's tons
of great Web content.

112
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,501
We want to get that on TV.

113
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,501
And the final idea
behind Google TV,

114
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,501
and this is really what
we're here to talk about,

115
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,501
is smart TV obviously
needs a platform

116
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,501
for interactive applications.

117
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,501
Manufacturers
were already starting

118
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,167
to kind of roll their own
vertical platforms for smart TV.

119
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,167
And we kind of said,

120
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,167
"Hey, we already have
a platform.

121
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,000
"We have two platforms,
actually,

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,334
Android and the Web Platform."

123
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,334
Both of those
make a great platform

124
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,501
for interactive TV apps.

125
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,501
With an interactive platform,

126
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,501
when you start thinking
about all the time

127
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,000
that you spend
parked in front of your TV,

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
there are some
really specific opportunities

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,801
that come to mind,

130
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,334
and we want to--to mention
a few of these particular areas,

131
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,334
that we're compelling, up front.

132
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:35,000
First, any
media consumption activity

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that might have a social aspect

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
can be really compelling on TV.

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,501
So if you want to watch the game
together with your friends,

136
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,000
but you don't actually want them
in your living room

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,167
eating your nachos,
drinking your beer,

138
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:49,334
um, you can do that if you have
an interactive platform

139
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:51,200
that can consume media

140
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,501
and connect to the internet
at the same time.

141
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,667
There's also a big opportunity
for applications

142
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,834
that span across devices
or environments.

143
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,000
The example
that I usually use here

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,167
is you can build an application
centered around food.

145
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,167
And you can sit on your couch

146
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,667
and watch episodes
of your favorite cooking show.

147
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,000
And then when you see something
that looks really tasty,

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you want to make it for dinner,

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,501
you head to the store,
and pull out your mobile device,

150
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,834
and the application now running
on your mobile device

151
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,167
already knows what
you were looking at,

152
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,167
and it gives you
a shopping list.

153
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,667
In fact, it might even guide you
based on your location

154
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,501
to what stores you need to go to
to get the right ingredients.

155
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,934
And then finally, you go back
to your kitchen.

156
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,501
You go to make the recipe.

157
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:35,334
And with your laptop
or your tablet

158
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,334
or another TV bolted
to your wall or whatever,

159
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,167
you get the actual recipe steps

160
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,834
and maybe videos on how
to properly caramelize onions

161
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,100
or something like that.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,801
Next, casual games are another
really interesting area for TV.

163
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:51,801
I say "casual games,"
and I mention games here

164
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:55,400
because obviously, games on TV
have a very long history.

165
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,200
Yes, I had an Atari 2600
at one point.

166
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Um, I don't say games
across the board here

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
because I think that
casual games are an opportunity.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,167
They really haven't been
nailed on TV yet.

169
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,501
Console games actually
very, very healthy--

170
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,834
uh, healthy ecosystem right now.

171
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,000
It's more--I think
there's a lot of opportunity

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,501
to build more casual games
and get them on the TV space

173
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,100
when you sit down,

174
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,501
and you want to kill a few--
few minutes playing something.

175
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,334
Which brings me
to the last opportunity

176
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,334
and this is the opportunity
to make connected applications

177
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,667
that pair
or work across devices,

178
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,501
and this is really

179
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:37,167
because I don't think I've
actually sat down to watch TV

180
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,501
any time in the last three
or four years

181
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,167
without having my mobile device
or a tablet

182
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,000
on me at the same time.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,501
Like, I'll check IMDb
or something like that.

184
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,734
And we have built a Google TV
remote control application

185
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,167
for iOS and Android

186
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,334
so you can effectively replace
your remote control

187
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:55,334
with your mobile device.
So you pull it out.

188
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,167
You can flip channels,
change the volume, whatever,

189
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:01,100
do searches,
drive the pointer device.

190
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,868
But that's not really the key
thing that I'm getting at here.

191
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:07,334
What we really want people
to focus on

192
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,334
is building applications

193
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,501
that connect mobile devices
and tablets

194
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,501
or any other device together

195
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:16,767
to drive the experience
on the big screen.

196
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,667
You already have in your hand

197
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,501
or your purse
or, uh, or your pocket,

198
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,501
um, a device that has
a ton of controllers on it,

199
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,000
a ton of sensors.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,734
You know, you have audio input.

201
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,734
You have an accelerometer
and a gyroscope,

202
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,834
audio--
and a touch screen display.

203
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:36,000
You, um--we want
to connect that to the TV.

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,634
We shouldn't need to give you

205
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,634
yet another remote control
to lose.

206
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,567
You're already carrying one.

207
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,567
So I think we want to give
a very quick demo

208
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:48,033
of a couple of applications
that show this sort of thing.

209
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:50,767
And the first one

210
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:54,000
is...

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,167
Interesting, it seems
to have lost me.

212
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,000
man: Hey, I don't have all day
here, people. Let's play.

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,501
Wilson: [laughs]

214
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,434
Well, let's see.

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So we're both trying
to join this.

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,033
I'm--I'm joining it
from an iPhone.

217
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,000
man: You need at least
two people to play "WeDraw."

218
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,501
Wilson: Dan is trying
to join it from...

219
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,400
Okay, why don't you know, uh...

220
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,868
Lee: You want to start?

221
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:24,501
Wilson: My iOS device
is actually unconnecting.

222
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,501
man: Everybody ready?
Let's do this.

223
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:30,000
Wilson: Okay. Connecting.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Hey, there we go.
man: Round 1, start.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wilson: So this application,
um--

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,734
one of us, and I'm not sure
who it is yet, gets to draw...

227
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,734
man: Player 1, get
those fingers ready.

228
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,734
Wilson: And this is
essentially like "Pictionary."

229
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,734
Alan Queen, right on,

230
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:45,033
from the audience, even.

231
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:48,334
So Alan gets a word
on his mobile device,

232
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,667
and it says
you should draw something.

233
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,400
And I'm gonna guess

234
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,501
that looks like a... snake.

235
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,267
Oh.

236
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,267
man: And player 4 makes
short work of the competition.

237
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,801
Wilson: All right!

238
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,801
Andre guessed "river,"
but I--I beat him to it.

239
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,434
So you can see all of us
are participating in this--

240
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:09,434
in this experience right now
from our own personal devices.

241
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,000
There are lots of other ideas
for applications

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,367
that you may want to, um, to
implement that work like this.

243
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,534
Uh, this is, uh,
a MOVL application.

244
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,501
They're actually
in the Sandbox today,

245
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,067
so they're showing off

246
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,200
some of their
other applications, as well.

247
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,501
Let me go ahead and close that.
Lee: [laughs]

248
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,834
Wilson: There are a lot of other
applications that really--

249
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,834
that don't yet make use of...
[bang]

250
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:33,000
Wilson: the sort of
paired controller idea,

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,934
but, um... [laughs]

252
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,501
but give you a lot of--

253
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,501
it's kind of a social aspect
in the living room,

254
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,501
and one of those that we want
to just show really quickly

255
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:44,000
was another HTML-based demo
called the KARAOKE Channel.

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,334
And Dan's gonna sing
for you here.

257
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,334
Lee: All right.

258
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:51,534
Wilson: I personally think
we should open up to a vote

259
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,000
as to what he sings,

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,501
but, um, I think
he had a-a request.

261
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,501
Um...

262
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:02,167
Oh, wait, there it was.

263
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:06,167
So this is actually
a relatively simple application,

264
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,501
um, but it's very compelling
on your big screen.

265
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,501
I'm gonna go ahead

266
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,934
and pop it full screen

267
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,167
so you get a more
TV-like experience.

268
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:19,167
Lee singing: Now I had

269
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,167
the time of my life.

270
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:26,167
No, I never
felt this way before.

271
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:30,334
Yes, I swear.
It's the truth.

272
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:31,834
And I--
[normal voice] Oh.

273
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,667
Wilson: [laughs]
[laughter]

274
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,667
Wilson: They're all
saying "mic," Dan.

275
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,601
[cheers and applause]

276
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,000
Wilson: So really, the key point
we're trying to get here

277
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,501
is that there are some
very engaging applications,

278
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,501
and having it on a big screen--
and obviously this might be

279
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,501
a little bit bigger
than your TV--

280
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,067
is a really good idea.

281
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:57,501
It's--it's a really good way
to engage multiple people.

282
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,000
Now as I mentioned before,

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Google TV and Android--
Google TV is based on Android.

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's--it's an Android device.

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,501
And we will be unlocking
the ability to, uh,

286
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:10,834
for consumers to install
Android applications very soon.

287
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,167
Christian and Jason
have a session about that side,

288
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,501
um, actually the next session
round this afternoon,

289
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,501
uh, up in building 11.

290
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,501
Er, building 11--room 11.

291
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:24,167
But here, we're talking
about the Web platform.

292
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:27,000
Now Google TV's Web platform
is Chrome.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,834
It has a special TV UI
applied to it

294
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,033
so you get, uh, an address bar

295
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,501
that doesn't always sit there
and take up space,

296
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,167
and you have
a very TV-centric design

297
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,167
to be driven
from a directional pad

298
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,167
navigation system.

299
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,000
But this means we have
a modern browser.

300
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We have HTML5.

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We have--we're built
on top of WebKit.

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,334
We also have Adobe Flash
implemented on Google TV.

303
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,501
We have H.264 video
natively implemented, as well,

304
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,501
so any--any content
that needs that

305
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,501
is--is gonna be there on TV.

306
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:00,267
And finally, I want to mention

307
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,334
we update automatically
over the network.

308
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,501
So the Web platform
gets better over time.

309
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:06,400
You don't have to do anything.

310
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,501
Um, mine at home has updated
multiple times already, so...

311
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,167
Now I basically just said

312
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,934
we support the Web platform.

313
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:16,934
If you're already
a Web developer,

314
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,534
I kind of said the magic words.

315
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,801
I said "WebKit"
and "Web platform."

316
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,801
So what more
do you need to know?

317
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,334
Like, you can all leave.

318
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,834
Um, we're only 15 minutes in
or something.

319
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,501
But it turns out

320
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:31,000
TV is a little bit
of a different space.

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,434
It's a different mental space.

322
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,334
Users tend to be
in what we sometimes call

323
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,367
"couch mode"
or "lean back" mode.

324
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:41,334
They're in this very passive
interaction mode.

325
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,667
They don't really want
to lean forward and, uh,

326
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,000
sit there with a keyboard
and a mouse and drive it.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In fact, I was sitting there
watching TV with my wife,

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and a commercial for interactive
TV came on one time,

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and my wife actually said,

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
"But I don't want
to be interactive.

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I just want to watch TV."

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,934
And I tried to explain
what I did again,

333
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:02,000
and she kind of got
a little confused.

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
[laughter]

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,501
Wilson: But the idea is,
well, you really need to--

336
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,501
to build a UI,
to build an application,

337
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,501
that is in that kind of space,
right,

338
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:13,334
that you provide a UI that
you're comfortable driving

339
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:16,167
kicking back on your couch
from 10 feet away.

340
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,501
[music playing]
[laughter]

341
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,834
Wilson: So I want to give--

342
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,000
wow, that's a weird--

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,334
so I want to give
a couple of examples

344
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:28,000
of Web sites that have already
gone and done this work,

345
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that have built a,
um, a 10-foot UI

346
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,667
of some--some form or another

347
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,167
and call out a few things
about 'em.

348
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,834
So this is Vimeo.

349
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,000
Um, I'm actually using Vimeo
as an example here

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
because I use YouTube later,

351
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,501
So, um, Vimeo is
a video content Web site,

352
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:45,534
and this is what I get.

353
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm already logged in as me.
Whoops.

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,834
This is what I get
if I don't lock my screen.

355
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:55,834
Um, it's got
a ton of stuff on it,

356
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:58,501
and the text is really small,
and it's hard for me to read,

357
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,267
and it's hard for me
to actually find

358
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,067
what it is that I'm--
I want to watch.

359
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,734
Like, maybe I want
to hear some more

360
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,434
about my camera or something.

361
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,434
But it's not really, um--you
know, I have to navigate this.

362
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,934
You also notice there's
a big scroll bar on the side.

363
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:14,000
There's actually a couple pages'
worth of--of content

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,934
just on this page alone.

365
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:17,501
And I'm not even sure

366
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,501
what the statistics thing
is on this page.

367
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,334
Now Vimeo also has

368
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:27,334
what they call Couch Mode,

369
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,467
and Couch Mode
is a little different

370
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:32,000
because Couch Mode--
when you go to Couch Mode,

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
this is what you get.

372
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The video starts
playing immediately,

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,501
and you can still navigate
through all the content.

374
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,667
You can find different things
to--to watch.

375
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,834
But this feels like TV, right?

376
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,334
You turn it on, and it just
starts playing content.

377
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,834
It's not like you have
to go discover and lean in

378
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,834
and figure out
what you want to do next.

379
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,133
It is kind of
a passive experience.

380
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,501
Similar to that--

381
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:59,167
this is "The Huffington Post"
news, uh, news site.

382
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,501
And again, you'll notice
there's a scroll bar,

383
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,200
and this one's
really impressive

384
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,400
because this is many, many,

385
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,801
many, many, many,
many pages of content,

386
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,934
and down at the bottom,
you have a huge, like--

387
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,501
the news source's menu
is even bigger

388
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:17,100
than what will--will fit on
my screen at a readable size.

389
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,801
And "The Huffington Post"
built an application

390
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,767
called NewsGlide

391
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,167
that gives a different
kind of experience,

392
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,000
and it's still a news site,

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and it's still kind of a static,

394
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
uh, static way
to look at the news,

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,334
but at the same time,
I can drive this

396
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:36,000
completely with the arrow keys
on my keyboard.

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,801
I don't need to use a--

398
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,801
I don't need to use a mouse
to navigate.

399
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:43,167
I--unfortunately because this is
running on the desktop browser,

400
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm getting a scroll bar.

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
On TV, you don't,
and it resizes properly

402
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,934
so you get a much better
experience there.

403
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,000
Now the point
we're trying to get--

404
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,334
to get at
with both of these, um,

405
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:59,033
both of these quick demos

406
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:03,000
are--go ahead and flip--

407
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,167
are--

408
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,434
uh, there's different concepts
you need to keep in mind.

409
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,434
There's--there's different ideas
behind what you need to do

410
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:13,067
to design for TV,

411
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,267
and they fall
into three basic categories.

412
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,267
The first one
is technical constraints,

413
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:19,501
and these are things
like resolution TV runs at

414
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,501
and color issues
and things like that.

415
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,501
Then there are
practical constraints,

416
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,834
which is when you sit 10 feet
away, things look smaller--

417
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,000
big surprise--
and what kind of input

418
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,033
you typically have on your couch
and that sort of thing.

419
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,000
And then finally, we want
to cover a few things

420
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,801
that are design guidance,

421
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,000
and these are
a little bit more fuzzy.

422
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,801
They're more, um, well, this is
what makes a "TV experience."

423
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,501
And that doesn't mean
you can't--

424
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,000
you absolutely
can't violate these.

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's whatever you do,

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
the user is gonna find that
a little bit weird

427
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,501
or a little bit different,
I should say, from regular TV.

428
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:55,000
So on the first one of these,
on resolution--

429
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,734
and this feels really weird,

430
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:59,501
'cause I'm a longtime
Web platform guy,

431
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,667
and, you know, one of the hot
things to discuss right now,

432
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,501
um, in the Web design world

433
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,501
is the concept
of responsive design,

434
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:09,000
building flexible designs
that go across screen sizes

435
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and window sizes.

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,267
TV has two resolutions
is the short version of this--

437
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,934
720p and 1080p--

438
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:18,000
and you can design
to those resolutions,

439
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,567
and that's okay.

440
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,567
Like, that's actually not
a bad thing to do at all.

441
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,167
It feels kind of weird,
but there you have it.

442
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:27,501
Except an old TV,

443
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:31,501
prior to HDTV, prior to
everyone having LCD flat panels,

444
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,167
um, there was this concept
called overscan.

445
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,667
And if you've never heard
of overscan before,

446
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:40,501
overscan is basically
on an old CRT-based display

447
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,334
the edges of the display
were kind of rounded off.

448
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:46,667
Um, some of the--the content
might get cut off

449
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,000
because of the rounded edges
of the display,

450
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,667
in the corners particularly,

451
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,167
because TVs typically
weren't exactly rectilinear.

452
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,501
And finally, the bezel
of the computer,

453
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,667
like, the plastic bit
around the tube itself,

454
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,434
could cut off
some of the content, too.

455
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,000
So they had rules

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
about where you were supposed
to put content

457
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,801
on one of these screens.

458
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,667
They had the "action safe" area

459
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,834
as basically the place where
you're supposed to display

460
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,834
anything that
the user doesn't really--

461
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,501
or the consumer needs to see.

462
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,334
So if you've got a character
in a video moving,

463
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:20,167
they probably want to stay
within that action safe space.

464
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,501
They might get cut off
on some displays occasionally,

465
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,000
but not a big deal.

466
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If you're putting titles
or any textual information

467
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,734
or anything like that up,

468
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,501
you want to keep it
between 5% and 10%

469
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,501
away from the edges,

470
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:35,667
and this is a fairly sizable
chunk of--of screen real estate.

471
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:38,167
And it's why,
if you watch TV shows,

472
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,334
um, particularly older TV shows,

473
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:43,334
they don't put the titles
or the characters or anything

474
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:45,534
off at the corners ever.

475
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:48,667
That's why those little annoying
channel pop-ups,

476
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,667
they're not way off
in the corner.

477
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,667
They're actually, you know,
they kind of, uh,

478
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,501
intrude into your space.

479
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,000
And that's because they know

480
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
they might get
cut off otherwise.

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,501
Now technically, you would think
LCDs and plasma displays

482
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,334
wouldn't have
this problem, right?

483
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,834
You know exactly what resolution
you're designing for.

484
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,901
You should have every one
of those pixels

485
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,400
on your screen, right?

486
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,067
And I actually thought
this was true,

487
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,067
and then I went
and looked at the data,

488
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:17,334
and it turns out that only
about 40% of HDTVs sold today

489
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,334
have all their pixels,

490
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:23,167
like, actually are designed
for exactly 1080p or 720p.

491
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:27,000
Um, up to about 30% of them

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,834
drop 10% to 12% of their pixels,

493
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,000
like, literally
just don't have them.

494
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So some displays
are still gonna be missing

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,501
the bits around the edge,
and you need to be careful

496
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,000
about having
a somewhat flexible display.

497
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This means the edges of your
screen may still get cut off.

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,667
Don't build right to the edges
is the short version.

499
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,801
As well, you'll notice that, um,

500
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,801
this is essentially
the same design.

501
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,834
I just faked up one of them
a little bit.

502
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,834
You don't really want
to build to the edges

503
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,501
because on TV,
it makes your screen

504
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,501
look kind of, uh, unbalanced.

505
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:01,067
You really want to use
some extra padding space,

506
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,734
have some negative space
between things

507
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,734
because the user is sitting
quite a ways away.

508
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:07,267
They don't see things

509
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,501
that are rammed right up
next to each other very well.

510
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,667
Now briefly, I want
to talk about color.

511
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,501
Um, the short version

512
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,501
is the color gamut
is different on TV

513
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,801
than what you may be used to
on a computer.

514
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:22,501
NTSC gamut is still typically
used for TV displays,

515
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,934
and it's both somewhat limited

516
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,734
compared to sRGB

517
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,167
or--or, um, or the Adobe gamut.

518
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,167
Uh, but the real problem

519
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,934
is that TVs are frequently
not calibrated.

520
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,267
In fact, I would flip
that around and say

521
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:39,501
TVs are almost never
actually calibrated for color.

522
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,501
So the worst part of this

523
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,000
is that it's very easy
to oversaturate,

524
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,734
and in fact, people buy
their TVs for that.

525
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:48,834
Many TVs have a retail setting

526
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:51,000
that actually flips it
into oversaturating

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,501
and--and cranking up

528
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,734
the brightness
and contrast, as well.

529
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,434
Because when somebody goes in
to Best Buy to buy a new TV,

530
00:21:57,434 --> 00:21:59,934
they typically look at all
the TVs that are out there,

531
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:02,000
and they pick the one
that's shiniest.

532
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Um, unfortunately, this is not
the one that's most accurate

533
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
or best at representing colors.

534
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's just the one
that's shiniest.

535
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,501
So be careful about having
very saturated colors

536
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,434
in your Web designs,

537
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,501
any design that goes on TV.

538
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,000
Particularly oranges and reds
tend to kind of blow out

539
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,667
the, uh, blow out
the saturation pretty quickly.

540
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:26,167
Another interesting, uh,

541
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,501
interesting thing that
I didn't realize at first

542
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,200
and then it started making sense

543
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,234
is, um, white

544
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:34,501
is the default background
of the Web, right?

545
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:38,000
If you just put doctype HTML
and nothing else in a document

546
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,334
and load it up,
you get a white screen.

547
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:43,801
That's typically not what
you would expect on a TV.

548
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:45,801
On a TV, you would expect it
to be black.

549
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,801
If you go to a channel
that's not playing anything,

550
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,567
they're usually showing
a black screen,

551
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,567
or they're showing
a test pattern.

552
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:56,000
Now this actually ends up
translating to the consumer.

553
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,334
If you look at something
that is all white

554
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,667
or heavily white on a TV,

555
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,667
it feels like your TV
is screaming at you.

556
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,033
It's like all caps.

557
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:07,000
It's really, really
in-your-face,

558
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and you don't generally
want that.

559
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,501
The other thing you have
to be careful about is, um,

560
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:13,501
if you use pure white
and pure black,

561
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,501
you will get halo effects
on some displays

562
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,400
because they're not
really designed

563
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,501
to do a very fast
transition back and forth

564
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:22,000
between opposite ends
of the spectrum.

565
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This--I think
you can actually see it

566
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
on the--the screen up here.

567
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Um, this is actually
a photo I took

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,501
of one of the TV screens
sitting at my desk,

569
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,067
and you can see, it's got

570
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:35,000
a weird little kind of
halo effect around each letter.

571
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That's not a, you know, that's
not a shadow effect or anything.

572
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,501
That actually is just showing up
on the TV screen.

573
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,734
And in fact, the other TV
I have on my desk

574
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:44,367
doesn't have it at all.

575
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:48,501
So it's definitely TV-to-TV.

576
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,501
And that actually brings up
to the last point

577
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,934
of test your contrast
on an actual TV display,

578
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,934
not on a computer monitor
but on a TV.

579
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,000
And in fact, not just one TV,

580
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,434
it's best to test
on several different TVs

581
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:02,067
because you will get

582
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,367
different frequency responses
from them.

583
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,000
On practical constraints,

584
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,501
text is one of the areas
where, um--

585
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:14,501
you know, I can give you, like,
very definitive guidance

586
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,501
like don't ever use
6-point font,

587
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,501
um, but really the idea is

588
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,000
you want to limit

589
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,334
how much content you're trying
to shove at the user,

590
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:24,501
how much textual content
you're shoving at the user,

591
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,167
on a TV display.

592
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,167
You want to limit
the length of content chunks.

593
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,834
You know, more than a paragraph
is probably more

594
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,934
than they're gonna want
to read at once on TV.

595
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:36,000
And make it as big as--

596
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,467
as you think
it could possibly be needed,

597
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,934
and then you might even want
to make it a little bit bigger.

598
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:42,501
Small text sizes,

599
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:44,501
even the larger text size
example here,

600
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,501
is on the small side
for TV content.

601
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,067
It's just--I was putting

602
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:51,000
a lot of content in that design
so I needed it.

603
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,501
Typical onscreen font guidance,
um, still applies.

604
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,501
Sans-serif fonts tend
to be more readable,

605
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,000
and don't use a ton
of different fonts on a page

606
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
because it's kind of jarring.

607
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
On that vein, we do support
font embedding on Google TV,

608
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,067
which is, uh, which is handy
for Web designs.

609
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,000
Scrolling--

610
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,434
one of my favorite topics
is scrolling

611
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,067
because scrolling--

612
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,000
you don't expect
your TV to scroll.

613
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,934
Um, you don't expect to have
to scroll on your TV

614
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,801
for a Web application.

615
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:23,000
Um, in newspapers,
they have this concept

616
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
called "above the fold"
or "below the fold."

617
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's basically the fold
in the newspaper,

618
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
whether you--when you have
to flip it over,

619
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,501
that's a big deal for--
for the user,

620
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,000
So anything important goes
on the first page.

621
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,501
TV doesn't really have
a below the fold

622
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,501
because if it--
if it's offscreen,

623
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:40,334
I'm probably not
ever gonna see it.

624
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:42,334
I'm not gonna think
to scroll down to it.

625
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,400
So give visual cues to the user
if there's more content

626
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
and make it very deliberate

627
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,000
if you're trying to--to make

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,033
a multipage
or large canvas design.

629
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,000
On that same vein,

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,167
um, have a very strong
focus model.

631
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:59,734
So this is one that I also
kind of screwed up on

632
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:03,501
on a couple of the prototypes
that I was building early on.

633
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:05,767
You really want the user
to be able to see

634
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,000
where they are in your design

635
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,200
and what they can do
in your design.

636
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,501
My--my example of how
to mess this up

637
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,501
is actually one that's currently
shipping nearly everywhere,

638
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,501
which is DVDs.

639
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,167
I load a ton of DVDs.

640
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,667
I have a 6-year-old daughter.
She watches lots of movies.

641
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,167
She puts the DVD in,

642
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,434
and you get to that page
where it says, you know,

643
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,000
like, "Play," "Scene Selection,"
"Bonus Features,"

644
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and I keep having to, like,
use the arrow keys

645
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,934
to figure out
where the cursor is

646
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,734
because the coloring
is so subtle

647
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:37,334
between the selected
and not-selected,

648
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:40,801
um, I can't tell
which one is selected.

649
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,300
Don't do that.

650
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,501
Like, make it really obvious
this one is selected

651
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,434
like in this design.

652
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:50,267
In that same vein,

653
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:53,501
the user is typically gonna use
the directional pad for control.

654
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:56,334
Um, they're already used
to this kind of concept

655
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:58,000
from their TV remote control,

656
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,601
from their DVD
or Blu-ray player

657
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,501
and, uh, and their gaming
console controller,

658
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:05,067
for that matter.

659
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,067
So thankfully, this is
really easy to support

660
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:08,601
in the Web platform.

661
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,167
It's just key presses.
It's arrow keys.

662
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,167
In fact, you saw me use
the arrow keys

663
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,968
in NewsGlide a few minutes ago.

664
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,968
This is kind of the same thing.

665
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,501
Um, it's actually useful
in desktop Web, as well.

666
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,100
Uh, Google search results
support this.

667
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,501
The Amazon Windowshop app
they released last fall

668
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:26,501
uses arrow key navigation.

669
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:29,000
And it actually kind of adds
a lot to the experience

670
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,801
if you can use arrow keys,
as well,

671
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:33,501
particularly for those of us
who like keyboard shortcuts.

672
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,000
The problem with this

673
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,167
is that the expected focus model
for TV

674
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,834
is two-dimensional.

675
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,167
Like, you expect to be able
to hit the "down" button

676
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,567
and go down visually
to the next focusable item.

677
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:50,033
And the Web platform
has this linear model

678
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,934
of "Tab" and "Shift"-"Tab."

679
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,000
And yes, I was around
when we invented that,

680
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,868
and it was a bad idea then.

681
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:58,000
It's really a bad idea
on the desktop Web, too.

682
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You'd like to be able
to navigate through links

683
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,567
using the arrow keys,

684
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,501
and there are add-ins
to do that.

685
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,501
But you do have
to implement this part.

686
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,000
We do have some tools for that.

687
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We'll talk about that
a little later.

688
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,167
And finally, um,

689
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:15,267
one of my biggest pet peeves
is the "Back" key

690
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:16,901
in Web applications.

691
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:18,901
When you're building
a Web application,

692
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,901
if you don't think about

693
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,834
what navigational model
is in your user's mind,

694
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,000
they're gonna find it
really disconcerting

695
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
when they go several steps
into your application,

696
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and they've opened up
what appears to be, like,

697
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,801
windows inside your application
or things like that,

698
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:34,801
and they hit "Back,"
and it takes them back

699
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,567
to whatever Web site
they were on

700
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:39,100
before they were looking
at your Web application.

701
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,067
It's pretty easy to fix this.

702
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:43,067
You set the window location hash

703
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,734
and respond to hash
change events.

704
00:28:44,734 --> 00:28:46,267
Although I will caution--

705
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,400
you don't want to do this
for every possible state change.

706
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,934
Like, that's--that's overkill.

707
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,934
You just want to do it
when it's a big thing

708
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:56,000
like opening up a window
in your application.

709
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,767
Now I want to point out
at this point

710
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,834
everything that I've said so far

711
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:02,834
actually applies to just TV.

712
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,501
It doesn't matter whether
you're using a Google TV device

713
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,501
or something else,

714
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,501
you know, Mac mini running

715
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:11,667
a different browser
attached to your TV.

716
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:14,667
It's really more when
you're displaying on a TV,

717
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,667
and you're using a remote
control kind of interface.

718
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,667
This is the one point
in this presentation

719
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,501
that is--that is
Google TV-specific.

720
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:23,501
We auto-zoom Web content.

721
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,834
So when you go to a Web site,
we're trying to make sure

722
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:28,834
that we're using
the maximum possible space.

723
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,167
And, um, if you want
to shut that off

724
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,167
in your Web application,
you can,

725
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,734
or if you want to control it,

726
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:38,501
you can do that through CSS,
as well.

727
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:41,000
Now on design guidance--

728
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,501
so these are a little bit,

729
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:44,501
like I said, they're
a little bit squishier.

730
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,300
They're not "you should do this"

731
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,501
or "this is how you do
this piece."

732
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:50,334
The first and foremost thing

733
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:54,000
is make use of every bit
of space you can on a TV display

734
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because you are sitting
10 feet back.

735
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You can't see things
that are really small.

736
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,501
Um, you'll notice,
this is YouTube on the left

737
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,501
and YouTube Leanback
on the right,

738
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,501
and the video is full screen
in YouTube Leanback.

739
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:08,334
I actually captured the controls

740
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:10,000
because I pulled them
up on screen

741
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
before I snapped the picture.

742
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,501
So it has all the controls,
and it has a navigation system,

743
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,167
but even that goes away

744
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,334
when you're actually just--
just watching a video.

745
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,968
You want to make the most use
of all the space you have.

746
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:24,834
And secondly, be sure
to actually sit back

747
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,834
and test your design on a TV

748
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:28,834
or preferably multiple TVs.

749
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,501
The reason why I say this is

750
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:33,501
it's really not enough
just to run it on a TV.

751
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,501
I have a TV on my desk

752
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,501
sitting right next
to a computer monitor

753
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,834
that's about the same size,

754
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,000
and they actually--
like, my design's gonna look

755
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
about the same
on either one of those.

756
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The problem is when I go

757
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,334
and put it on my other
TV monitor and--or my other TV,

758
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:51,334
and I sit back 10 feet away,

759
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:53,033
things look very different.

760
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,000
You know, I can't read the text
that I wrote,

761
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that I put up there
in 10-point font.

762
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I might need to have it
in 24-point font.

763
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,167
So be sure to actually test it
in a TV situation,

764
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,667
not just on a TV
when you're building TV designs.

765
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,501
And this is a consistent thing.

766
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:10,000
When you're thinking about
the design of your application,

767
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
don't think, Well, I'm putting
this on a 1080p display,

768
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,501
so I've got, you know,

769
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,000
19 20x1080 pixels
to work with, right?

770
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,434
It's not quite the same
as doing that on the desktop.

771
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:25,501
Um, final bits
of--of design guidance,

772
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:28,667
kind of TV app guidance,
on TV in particular--

773
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,834
TV tends to be a very,
very dynamic experience,

774
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:34,501
mostly because the users of TV
are very passive.

775
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,667
The users of TV
are kind of like, you know,

776
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,167
they're couch potatoes.

777
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,667
They're not really paying--

778
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,667
uh, they're not really driving
all that much.

779
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,334
You want to make sure
to give them

780
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,334
lots of visual feedback
about what's going on

781
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:47,000
so they don't think
their computer--

782
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,167
or their TV experience
has stalled out.

783
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:51,167
Like, if you flip
to a TV channel

784
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,801
and everything's static,

785
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:55,400
you kind of say, "Well, hmm,

786
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
"TV channel's computer
must have crashed.

787
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,033
I'll flip to another channel."

788
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:02,934
You need to make sure
not to let your users do that.

789
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,734
So give visual feedback.

790
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:07,000
If you're loading something,
show a loading icon.

791
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,667
If something's gonna take
a few seconds, tell them that.

792
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:12,334
You probably want
to give them directions, too,

793
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:14,501
because this is kind of
a new paradigm.

794
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,167
They don't know to hit "Down,"

795
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,167
and that's what brings up
your tool bar, whatever.

796
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:21,167
So make sure to give them a
splash screen or steps to that,

797
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:24,167
or make it so that your controls
pop in very intuitively.

798
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:28,000
You hit any key,
and they--they show up.

799
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,167
And as I said,

800
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:34,167
uh, experiences tend
to not be static on TV.

801
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,501
If you flip on the news,

802
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:38,501
um, and just watch the screen,

803
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:40,667
not the person talking
but watch the screen,

804
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,667
elements on the screen,

805
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,934
most of them have, like,
dynamic backgrounds.

806
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:47,501
They have subtle animations
going on in the background,

807
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:50,000
or they have other things
that are moving underneath them

808
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,667
to hold the user's interest.

809
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:54,000
You probably want to replicate
that kind of effect.

810
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Use transitions to show, uh,

811
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,534
to show motion
between different states.

812
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,501
And so now we've talked

813
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:05,501
about kind of the--the general
sets of guidance

814
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:08,000
and the practical
and technical constraints.

815
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,334
We want to talk
about the tools that we have

816
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:14,000
to help people build, um,
TV-optimized experiences.

817
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,734
The first one is if you want
to build a video content site.

818
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:20,501
So you have a-a-a pool
of video content,

819
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,834
and you want to get it up
and make it optimized for TV.

820
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,334
We have a set of TV UI templates
to do this.

821
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,501
These are implemented
in both HTML and Flash,

822
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:30,501
and there's
two different templates.

823
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,501
That's one on the left
and one on the right.

824
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:34,067
They're really
just a different view

825
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,501
of how you might want
to present your content.

826
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:39,033
Um, both of these
are in HTML5 and Flash.

827
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:41,501
Both of them support
directional pad navigation

828
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:43,501
and the video playback controls,

829
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:46,167
so like the "Play," "Pause,"
"Stop" buttons.

830
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,501
Um, and we have these
site templates up on the--

831
00:33:49,501 --> 00:33:51,667
on code site,
so you can get them from there.

832
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,100
There's a short link to them.

833
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,501
But this is really only if you
want to build a top/down design,

834
00:33:57,501 --> 00:33:59,334
and you can rebrand this,
of course.

835
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:00,868
That's the whole point,

836
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:02,934
is you can put whatever
branding you want in it,

837
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,734
use some styling to change it,

838
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:07,000
but functionally,
it'll still work the same way.

839
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If you want to do more
than that,

840
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,634
or you already have a site

841
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,634
and you want to add
some optimization for it,

842
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,501
we have a set
of--a set of UI libraries

843
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:17,000
that can help you do that.

844
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
For this, I'm gonna
hand you over to Dan,

845
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,501
and he can talk
about what we have there.

846
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:26,434
[applause]

847
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,834
Lee: Great. Thank you, Chris.

848
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:32,501
So, uh, as Chris mentioned,

849
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:35,501
yeah, I'm gonna talk about
some of the Web UI libraries

850
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:38,000
that we have, uh, for
you Web developers out there

851
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,667
to help you with
your implementation

852
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,834
with developing a 10-foot user--

853
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:45,000
user interface for your TV apps.

854
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,667
So there's two main UI libraries

855
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,667
that we developed.

856
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,000
And, um, just to give you
a little brief history--

857
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,334
we launched these at the very
beginning of--of this year

858
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:56,334
around the end of January.

859
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:58,501
We had a blog post go out
on Google TV

860
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:00,501
in the beginning of February,

861
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,934
and there was two different
libraries that we introduced.

862
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,567
And the main reason--
and the main--

863
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,067
I think the primary goal

864
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:08,067
that we wanted to make
of--of these projects

865
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:11,334
was to really make,
uh, keyboard navigation

866
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,334
much, much simpler and easier

867
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:15,501
for you guys to develop
and to use.

868
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,801
Um, keyboard navigation
is essentially

869
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:19,834
what enables a D-pad, right,

870
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,501
in your app--
in your application.

871
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,000
As--as Chris mentioned,

872
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
with developing your--
your Web app for Google TV,

873
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
this is an extremely
critical piece

874
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
to creating
an optimal user experience,

875
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
um, with that optimal
user interaction, right?

876
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,167
You want your users to be able
to navigate your site,

877
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,667
your Web app,
using these arrow keys.

878
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:43,000
And we found that this was not
always incredibly easy to do,

879
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
especially if your UI
was a little bit more complex,

880
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
so we had two different
UI libraries

881
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,801
that you--that were
sort of derived

882
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,501
of two different
common libraries

883
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:53,501
that you guys might be
already familiar with.

884
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,000
One is jQuery,

885
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,067
and the other
is the Closure library.

886
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:00,434
I want to talk about some of
the high-level summaries that--

887
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,067
sort of the subtle differences

888
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,400
that exist between
the two libraries

889
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
to help you decide
which one to--

890
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,501
is a better fit for you
as a developer.

891
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:10,334
If you're already
a customer of--

892
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,734
if you're already a developer
of the jQuery library,

893
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:15,501
I think that's a pretty simple
choice down there for you.

894
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,834
The jQuery library's probably
what makes most sense

895
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,834
if that's what
you're already using

896
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,000
within your
existing applications.

897
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,334
Um, Closure library, if--
if you're--same reasons there.

898
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,667
If you're using Closure library,
that's--that's awesome,

899
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,501
um, and I would continue maybe

900
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:31,501
checking out
that library instead.

901
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:33,334
But let's say
you haven't used either,

902
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:36,000
and you sort of want
to evaluate between the two.

903
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
Here, I have--I'm gonna
just talk about a little bit

904
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
some of the differences.

905
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And jQuery library requires
a little bit more JavaScript.

906
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So it's a little bit more
heavier on the JavaScript side,

907
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,567
so it's gonna do a lot more,

908
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:49,200
where you're gonna be sort of
configuring your library

909
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
using JavaScript
a little bit more

910
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,000
whereas the Closure library,

911
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,501
you're sort of doing more
within your HTML markup.

912
00:36:56,501 --> 00:37:00,267
So you're essentially decorating
common HTML elements

913
00:37:00,267 --> 00:37:02,000
like--like DIV containers

914
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
or unordered list containers

915
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,334
or span elements and so forth

916
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:09,334
and just decorating them
with special class names

917
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:12,000
that the library
will then parse through

918
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and essentially, you know, do--

919
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,567
apply some logic to that

920
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,300
and include that within
your keyboard navigation.

921
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,834
The jQuery library,

922
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:23,000
instead, you'll be using things
like CSS selector strings,

923
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,501
which if you're already
using jQuery

924
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:27,501
you might be familiar with.

925
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,834
And one additional thing
that it--it provides

926
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:33,200
is we offer--which is currently
in beta, by the way--

927
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,501
is a set of common UI controls,

928
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,834
things like horizontal carousels

929
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:41,000
like--like slider controls

930
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,834
or the embedding of--of photos,
doing, like, a slide show,

931
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,667
or embedding videos.

932
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,000
It includes some library--some
additional libraries like that,

933
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
which are part
of the jQuery UI library,

934
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,334
and it integrates
keyboard navigation within that.

935
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:54,801
So--so those are some
additional UI controls

936
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,801
that the jQuery UI library
offers

937
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,734
which the Closure library
doesn't.

938
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,000
On the other hand,
the Closure UI library,

939
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,501
however, offers you, um,

940
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:06,868
you know, really, really raw
building blocks to build

941
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,000
a really customized and really
complex user interface.

942
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So it--it contains, you know,
your building blocks

943
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,667
as with like horizontal
and vertical containers,

944
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,667
with scrollable components
within,

945
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,501
but it also contains extensions
of those components

946
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,334
such as buttons.

947
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,667
Um, you can sort of create
links, you know,

948
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:28,501
where it immediately can
navigate to a different URL

949
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,667
if--if the "Enter" key
gets pressed,

950
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,167
and they can listen for that.

951
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:34,167
Um, it has menu controls,
as well.

952
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,734
So these are--these--

953
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,934
and I'll show you some examples
of this later on,

954
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:39,934
but those are some
of the subtle differences,

955
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,501
I'd say, between the two.

956
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:43,167
So the Closure library's

957
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,400
a little bit more sort of
starting from the ground up,

958
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,334
where the jQuery, I think,
provides you with a little bit--

959
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:52,000
it tries to do
a little bit more for you.

960
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
There's three main--
three main steps,

961
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,834
uh, in getting started on
using these--these libraries

962
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,167
if you want to use them,

963
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,501
and really--they're
really highlighted here,

964
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:04,000
and there's stuff that if you're
a Web developer out there,

965
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,501
this is stuff that you're
probably already familiar with.

966
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:09,501
Um, but really, it's these
simple three steps

967
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,501
where you're using HTML markup

968
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,834
to define the structure
of--of your UI.

969
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:18,167
So you are gonna specify,
you know, using HTML,

970
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,501
you know, which component,
what are your components

971
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:23,501
that you want selectable
with the cursor, you know,

972
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,501
and then how do you--
do you want them

973
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:28,501
to be selectable horizontally,
using left and right keys,

974
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,501
versus up/down.

975
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,501
Second is CSS.

976
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:34,501
You're gonna be using CSS3

977
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:36,501
because you know
you're developing

978
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,000
your Web app on Chrome,

979
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and that's a huge benefit,
as Chris mentioned,

980
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
because you're only dealing
with one browser here.

981
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,834
You know what HTML5 capabilities
are available.

982
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:46,834
You know what WebKit transitions

983
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,834
and transforms you can use.

984
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,334
And so you're gonna
really be using CSS a lot

985
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:54,000
to present and help you
sort of visualize--

986
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,667
apply visualization to these--
these, you know,

987
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,501
these--these HTML components

988
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,501
that you're adding
within your Web app.

989
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,501
And then lastly,
you're using JavaScript

990
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,501
to really initialize--

991
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,501
it's really used to initialize
the library,

992
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:10,834
initialize the keyboard
navigation to be active,

993
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:14,501
to essentially parse through
your HTML DOM, for example,

994
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:16,834
and look for those
special class names

995
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,501
or select all the, you know,

996
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,501
all of the nodes that match
the CSS selective strings

997
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,501
and then to--and then

998
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,501
to make them keyboard navigable.

999
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,434
So here's--here's, uh,

1000
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,434
the next, you know, few set
of slides, I want to--

1001
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:32,434
I want to go over a little bit
more in depth, right,

1002
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:36,000
like the different steps in
terms of using each library.

1003
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So I want to start with jQuery,

1004
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,501
and this is a little bit of a,
you know, a visual diagram

1005
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:42,501
of--of what may be--
what the zone--

1006
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,501
you know, what--how you would
sort of lay out your structure.

1007
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,501
Let's say you wanted to use
the slider, right?

1008
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:51,000
So there's a concept of--
of keyboard behavior zones,

1009
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,033
and these zones are essentially

1010
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,000
nothing more
than HTML containers,

1011
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,834
so I typically use these
with developments

1012
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:00,434
or a UL, unordered list element.

1013
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,667
And then, you know,
within each zone,

1014
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,834
you can contain a list

1015
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,834
of a variety of different
HTML components,

1016
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,000
which can--which are, again,
are just HTML elements

1017
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
that you're already
familiar with.

1018
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
They can be image tags.
They can be paragraph tags.

1019
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,567
You can do whatever you want.

1020
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,434
And you're essentially
gonna identify--

1021
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:19,434
you're gonna create some way
to indentify those components

1022
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:21,434
within each zone.

1023
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,434
And each zone
is essentially--

1024
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:26,367
um, you know, can be scrolled--

1025
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:30,000
it can be selected, you know,
left or right,

1026
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
depending on whether or not

1027
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,501
you want them to be selected
horizontally or vertically.

1028
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,501
Um, and so in
your jQuery library,

1029
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:39,000
you're essentially
in your HTML structure

1030
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
going to be setting up,
you know, different--

1031
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
different zones with different
selectable components within.

1032
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,734
One added benefit

1033
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:47,734
that the jQuery library
takes care of for you

1034
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:50,734
is that when you're navigating
up and down between zones,

1035
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:53,934
it's automatically gonna
remember the last selected item

1036
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:55,434
within each zone,

1037
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:57,067
so that's something
that's convenient

1038
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:59,434
that the library
takes care of for you.

1039
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,501
The last optional feature,
which I want to just mention,

1040
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:05,834
is really great for,
uh, quick prototyping.

1041
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:09,000
So let's say you have already
an existing Web site

1042
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,334
or a Web app
that you want to see what it--

1043
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:13,334
you know, you want
to quickly enable

1044
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:16,167
keyboard navigation
on your Web app.

1045
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,934
The jQuery UI library provides

1046
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,601
something called
a Geometry feature.

1047
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:22,501
So you can toggle this flag
called useGeometry

1048
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,067
and set it to true,

1049
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:26,501
and when it does that,
it'll sort of--

1050
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:29,067
you know, based on, you know,
an Euclidean--

1051
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:31,267
it uses an Euclidean
distance algorithm,

1052
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:34,033
and it tries to calculate,
What's the next closest item

1053
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:37,501
to the right, top, bottom,
or left of this item

1054
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,334
that I'm currently at?

1055
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,334
And so when the user
hits "Right,"

1056
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:44,501
it'll try its best to select
the next most intuitive element

1057
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:46,501
that it should go to.

1058
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,501
Like I said, this is great
for prototyping.

1059
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,734
I don't--I wouldn't recommend
leaving it turned on

1060
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,734
if you're going
to full production

1061
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:55,000
because there's,
you know, visual--

1062
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,334
potentially maybe
some visual differences

1063
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:01,834
maybe that you're just sort of
less in control over

1064
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:04,667
exactly where the focus
is gonna move to next.

1065
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,033
So, uh, it's great
for prototyping,

1066
00:43:07,033 --> 00:43:10,167
um, but not meant
for full production.

1067
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:12,501
Here's an example of, uh,

1068
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:14,501
of the HTML structure that you--

1069
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:17,000
that--one example
of what it might look like.

1070
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Let's say you wanted to build
some interface.

1071
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,934
Um, here's a concept.

1072
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,934
This is just HTML markup here,

1073
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,167
so you're essentially
creating two zones--

1074
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,167
I'm essentially
creating two zones here,

1075
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,000
a zone one and a zone two.

1076
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,667
Within the zone,
I'm defining a set of rows.

1077
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:36,334
I can have one, two,
as many item rows

1078
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,334
as--as poss--as I want.

1079
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:41,501
And I'm setting a class--
a special class name

1080
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:43,167
called "item-row,"

1081
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,334
which I'm gonna be using
CSS selective strings

1082
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:48,334
to tell the jQuery UI library
"Here are my rows."

1083
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,000
And my rows are navigable
horizontally from left to right.

1084
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,934
Within each row, I'm embedding
individual components

1085
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:58,934
that I'm also identifying
using semantic class names,

1086
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:01,334
so I'm calling it
a class "item,"

1087
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:03,334
and I'm saying for those items,

1088
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:06,000
I want those
to be focusable, right?

1089
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So--so you can imagine,
with this sort of a structure,

1090
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,501
you can really--
depending on, you know, how--

1091
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:15,000
the sizing you would
control using CSS,

1092
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,501
you know, your width and height
rules and so forth.

1093
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:21,501
Um, but you can really do
a lot of nesting

1094
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,501
to create a variety
of different rows

1095
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:27,000
and then different components--
selectable components within.

1096
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I wanted to just,
again, mention,

1097
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,501
you know, that CSS
is incredibly important

1098
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:35,334
in terms of laying out your--
your HTML

1099
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:37,501
and--and presenting them
to the user

1100
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:40,834
to help visualize how you want
your items to be navigable.

1101
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:42,667
So, for example,

1102
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,000
if you can read some
of the CSS rules here--

1103
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,200
you don't have to look through
all of them--

1104
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,501
but, you know, I'm applying
everything from some margins

1105
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,834
to, you know, some dimensions,
width and height,

1106
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:55,501
and also border radiuses
and so forth.

1107
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:57,501
Last--the last step
which I mentioned--

1108
00:44:57,501 --> 00:44:59,501
you know, there was three steps,

1109
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:01,734
and JavaScript is--is what
you're gonna be using

1110
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:04,501
to initialize
keyboard navigation

1111
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,000
for, uh, your HTML markup,

1112
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,934
which has already been set up
in the way I just showed you.

1113
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:11,501
And so this is an example.

1114
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,501
This is just a code snippet

1115
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,501
of how you would essentially
create new instances

1116
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:17,834
of a key behavior zone object.

1117
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:19,834
Within the key behavior
zone object,

1118
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:23,167
contains a variety
of different object parameters

1119
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:27,334
that you're gonna use to
configure and tell the library

1120
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:30,501
how to identify which components
are selectable,

1121
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:33,501
which components are rows
and so forth.

1122
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:35,334
Some things I want
to highlight here

1123
00:45:35,334 --> 00:45:37,334
is the CSS selective strings,
right?

1124
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,501
So I'm telling the library
for every--every--

1125
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:44,000
every, uh, every HTML element
that has a class name item,

1126
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I want that to be selectable.

1127
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Um, I'm going to tell it,
you know, every--every--

1128
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,667
every class name that
has a specified item-row,

1129
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,167
that's gonna be represented
as a row.

1130
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,501
The selection class's property

1131
00:45:57,501 --> 00:46:00,000
is--is what you're gonna be
using to tell the library,

1132
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you know, when--when my user

1133
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,501
is actually focused
on a specific element,

1134
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:06,501
it's going to apply--

1135
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:09,501
essentially append
this specific class name

1136
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,167
to that element.

1137
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:14,501
So in my CSS, I can then give it
some special styling

1138
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:17,000
to make it very apparent
to the user

1139
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,167
where my current focus is.

1140
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:22,501
And lastly, the last example,
is key mapping.

1141
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,567
There's a key mapping property

1142
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:27,534
where you can specify a variety
of different key codes.

1143
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,934
So these key codes are available
on the Web, right?

1144
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:33,000
And--and 13 is the key code
that register--

1145
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,801
that fires when the user
hits the "Enter" key.

1146
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:37,501
And I'm telling
jQuery library here

1147
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,934
to call my "Enter"
callback function,

1148
00:46:39,934 --> 00:46:41,934
which I have to find
somewhere else,

1149
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:45,000
to handle that--that event
when it gets fired.

1150
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,801
And at the bottom there--

1151
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:49,000
the bottom box essentially
just shows how you--

1152
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,067
how it essentially ties
everything together.

1153
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:54,801
So we have a-a top level--
a key controller object,

1154
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:56,400
which you're creating
a new instance of,

1155
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,000
and then you're creating--

1156
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,767
you're adding the two behavior
zones that I created to it,

1157
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:02,801
and then you're calling
a start method

1158
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:04,434
with the very first zone

1159
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:07,334
that you want
to start the selection on.

1160
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:10,167
So that's--that's essentially
a very, very quick

1161
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,434
and dumb-downed
sort of code snippet

1162
00:47:12,434 --> 00:47:15,934
and how easy it is to enable
keyboard navigation

1163
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,934
on your Web app.

1164
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:20,501
I want to go through
the same set of steps now

1165
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,501
with the--with the exception

1166
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:24,501
of now we're talking
about Closure library,

1167
00:47:24,501 --> 00:47:27,501
because--just to show you
a little bit subtle differences

1168
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:29,000
between the two.

1169
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And this is sort of
the conceptual model

1170
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,033
of how the Closure UI library
works instead.

1171
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:34,734
So we had the concept

1172
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:37,000
of horizontal and vertical
building blocks.

1173
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,667
So these are, again,
nothing but HTML containers.

1174
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:43,000
And one of the key differences

1175
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,334
between the jQuery
and the Closure

1176
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:47,501
is that the jQuery library,
like I said,

1177
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:51,000
you're--you're specifying
in your--in your constructor,

1178
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
you know, which--which objects,

1179
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,667
which HTML elements
I want to include

1180
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,501
using CSS selective strings.

1181
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,501
But in the Closure UI library,

1182
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,934
you're essentially doing this
directly within your markup.

1183
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:03,601
So in your--in your HTML markup,

1184
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:06,000
you're--you're specifying
class names,

1185
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,033
these special class names,

1186
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:10,834
that all start out
with a "tv-" prefix.

1187
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:13,334
So things like
"tv-container-horizontal"

1188
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:15,400
will indicate to the library

1189
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,901
that I want this container
to be scrollable--

1190
00:48:18,901 --> 00:48:22,334
to be navigable left--
using left and right keys.

1191
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,334
It also contains--

1192
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,667
we also have special class names
to identify

1193
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:29,334
which containers
can be scrollable.

1194
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:31,334
And so within your CSS,

1195
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:35,000
if you specify
like a smaller viewport window,

1196
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
so a small width
and a small height

1197
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,501
that only shows, let's say,
three components inside,

1198
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,033
you can specify that

1199
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:43,000
to be a scrolling container
very easily,

1200
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,501
similarly by applying
a class name.

1201
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:47,334
And then I briefly talked

1202
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:50,801
about how there's different
extensions of TV components,

1203
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,667
which are--are all
gonna be selectable

1204
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,801
with your keyboard navigation,

1205
00:48:55,801 --> 00:48:57,801
and this could include things

1206
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,501
like buttons and links
and also input, for example.

1207
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:04,000
So what does the HTML markup
look like

1208
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
for this library instead?

1209
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So this is
a very similar example.

1210
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,501
Uh, I have essentially
two snippets

1211
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:14,501
of, uh, a UL element
with class name--

1212
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:18,167
the special class names
"tv-container-horizontal"

1213
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,000
and "tv-container-vertical."

1214
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And that's essentially saying
to the library

1215
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,501
"I want this container

1216
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,501
"to be navigable
using left/right keys

1217
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:27,501
"and then the other one
to be navigable

1218
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:29,067
using up and down arrow keys."

1219
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,067
Within my--my horizontal
and vertical containers,

1220
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,067
I have three
different components,

1221
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:35,167
which I'm specifying
as a TV component,

1222
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,834
and that's telling the library

1223
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:38,834
that I want this
to be selectable.

1224
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:40,834
If I had additional elements
in there

1225
00:49:40,834 --> 00:49:42,834
that were not labeled
with that class,

1226
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:44,834
then the library
wouldn't recognize it

1227
00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:46,834
and include it in that container

1228
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:49,334
as they're navigating
with their keyboard.

1229
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:51,334
And then the last thing
on the right,

1230
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:53,834
I show you, again, some examples
of the CSS styling rules

1231
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:57,000
that is really critical
to helping to visualize,

1232
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,167
uh, or represents these--
these HT--this markup

1233
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,501
and make it look sort of
the way you want it to navigate.

1234
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,501
So for example, for--for
all list elements

1235
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:09,334
within my horizontal container,

1236
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,334
I want to apply a display--

1237
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:13,501
an inline block display rule,

1238
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:16,000
which is gonna stack them,
you know--

1239
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,334
instead of stacking them
one below each other,

1240
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:22,167
I'm gonna put them
next to each other instead.

1241
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:25,000
On this slide, I wanted
to also show

1242
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
that as an example, uh,

1243
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,501
TV container--like, horizontal
and vertical containers

1244
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:34,501
are not, uh, do not have to be
stand-alone on themselves.

1245
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:38,334
You can actually use them
to nest within each other,

1246
00:50:38,334 --> 00:50:40,501
um, and this is actually part

1247
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:43,501
of how you would actually build
a complex UI with this.

1248
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:45,834
'Cause you can imagine you have
a variety of different--

1249
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,667
maybe you have one top-level
vertical container

1250
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:51,334
that you want to be able

1251
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:53,334
to create, essentially,
different zones almost,

1252
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:55,667
similar to what--what
I showed you with jQuery,

1253
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:58,167
and create a variety
of different rows, um,

1254
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:02,167
that you're creating
using the horizontal containers.

1255
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,868
The next point I wanted
to talk about

1256
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:06,868
is I mentioned
scrolling containers.

1257
00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:09,801
So if I have, uh, a list of--

1258
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,501
a long list of elements,

1259
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,501
TV components within
a scrolling container,

1260
00:51:14,501 --> 00:51:17,334
such as--like, that's going
vertically in this example,

1261
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,000
and let's say I use CSS

1262
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,801
to minimize the viewport
of my vertical container

1263
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:25,167
to only show three components
at a time.

1264
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:28,167
I can essentially just wrap
all my child components

1265
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,934
around a special, uh, class name

1266
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,934
called
"tv-container-start-scroll,"

1267
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:34,501
and as I'm scrolling down,

1268
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:36,501
the library
will magically enable this

1269
00:51:36,501 --> 00:51:39,934
so that if--as the user
heads down on the arrow keys,

1270
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:41,501
it's going to always maintain--

1271
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:44,501
it's gonna--it's--
it's gonna scroll--

1272
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,501
the vertical container's
gonna translate it

1273
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:49,667
using WebKit transforms

1274
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:53,000
to move down to--to show
the next, you know,

1275
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,501
the next component that--
that's below it.

1276
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:57,501
And so it just kind of
works magically,

1277
00:51:57,501 --> 00:52:00,133
and it really--
it really is up to you

1278
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:02,334
to use, uh, CSS rules

1279
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:05,501
to--to enable the interaction

1280
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,334
to appear this way.

1281
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,334
And lastly, JavaScript is--

1282
00:52:10,334 --> 00:52:12,334
this is the last piece
of JavaScript

1283
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:15,334
that you're really gonna be
using to enable this library

1284
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:17,334
to sort of initialize

1285
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,667
and scan through your HTML DOM

1286
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,667
and look for these
special class names

1287
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:25,667
and then include it within
your keyboard navigation scheme.

1288
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:27,667
So essentially,
what I'm showing here--

1289
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:29,834
there's a single method
that you're gonna be calling

1290
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,834
called "tv.ui.decorate,"

1291
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:35,000
and within that, you're passing
in the route parent HTML node

1292
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
where it's then gonna
scan through

1293
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
all of his child elements
and look for these--

1294
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,801
these specially decorated
class names.

1295
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:44,334
And then at the bottom there,

1296
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:46,334
you're essentially
just calling "tryFocus"

1297
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:47,934
on the first element

1298
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:51,667
that you want to start out
your focus on.

1299
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,400
So I want to just show
really quick

1300
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
a few demos, uh,

1301
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,167
of essentially
very similar interfaces,

1302
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:01,100
but I wanted to show
some building blocks

1303
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,934
that are using both the Closure
library and the jQuery.

1304
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:07,534
I think visually,
they're--they're not

1305
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:09,501
going to necessarily appear
very different,

1306
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:11,167
but they're both--

1307
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,567
it just goes to show
that you can really accomplish

1308
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:16,834
the same--
very similar interfaces

1309
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:18,400
with both libraries,

1310
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,334
that it's really
a matter of taste

1311
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:23,434
and depending on
what it is you want to do.

1312
00:53:28,934 --> 00:53:30,934
Am I, uh, connected?

1313
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:33,868
Wilson: [speaking indistinctly]

1314
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:43,601
Lee: I could have had this...

1315
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:48,767
Lee: Could be I lost
our internet connection.

1316
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:58,200
Hmm.

1317
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,434
I'm gonna try this again.
Mm...

1318
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:19,200
Are you on Wi-Fi?
Let me try this.

1319
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:29,934
[man speaking indistinctly]

1320
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,000
Lee: [laughs]
That's a good request.

1321
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,501
Uh, I'll have karaoke
for you afterwards

1322
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:37,167
in the Sandbox area.
[laughs]

1323
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:40,667
I'll take requests, too.
[chuckles]

1324
00:54:40,667 --> 00:54:43,000
Wilson: All right.

1325
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Lee: Okay, um,

1326
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,534
so unfortunately,
we're having some Wi-Fi--

1327
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,501
or--or...
Wilson: Wired.

1328
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:52,000
Lee: Wired
internet connection issues.

1329
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,968
Um, if you go to that--
that go link, um,

1330
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:58,000
you can actually check out
some of the demos yourself.

1331
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,934
And all of--you can navigate
the entire demo site

1332
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:03,934
using, uh, using keyboard,

1333
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,501
and that's the whole point,
right?

1334
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:08,000
And so it's actually
a really good--good exercise

1335
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,934
for you to check out
those demos,

1336
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:11,734
look at
the various examples within,

1337
00:55:11,734 --> 00:55:13,334
and then look at the--
view the source,

1338
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:16,501
and you'll see how simple
the HTML markup actually looks,

1339
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:18,667
um, and then you'll see
the JavaScript library--

1340
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,300
the calling functions
which I showed you here.

1341
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,000
So, uh, so, thank you,

1342
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and then I guess
I'll give it back to Chris.

1343
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,167
Wilson: Thanks, Dan.
[applause]

1344
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:32,334
Wilson: So--thanks.

1345
00:55:32,334 --> 00:55:35,434
So really, what we're asking
people to do is to think about

1346
00:55:35,434 --> 00:55:38,434
how the applications you're
already building might work

1347
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:40,434
in the TV space
in the living room.

1348
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:42,100
Think about what
new applications

1349
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,667
actually you could build
because you're in that space.

1350
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,334
And also, I personally believe

1351
00:55:48,334 --> 00:55:50,334
there are a lot of lessons
we can learn

1352
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:52,000
about how to build
better experiences

1353
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,801
that work on desktop and mobile

1354
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:56,501
and are more effective
in those spaces, as well,

1355
00:55:56,501 --> 00:55:58,501
once you look at how that works

1356
00:55:58,501 --> 00:56:00,367
when you're kind of
kicking back.

1357
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,434
And finally, you know,
get a Google TV device,

1358
00:56:02,434 --> 00:56:04,067
start building applications.

1359
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:06,067
Um, if you have applications
you want to build

1360
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,801
and you need a device,
get ahold of us.

1361
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:09,801
We can--I'm sure we can work
something out.

1362
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:11,300
We have a code site.

1363
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,501
We have a forum that we
participate in quite a bit.

1364
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:18,000
And with that, we're actually,
um, just about out of time,

1365
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,501
so, uh, uh, I do want to ask
that anyone who can

1366
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:24,501
please provide feedback
on the session.

1367
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,400
That helps us get better.

1368
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,801
And, um, our hash tags
are up there.

1369
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:31,934
So if you have questions,
come on up, ask them to us,

1370
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:34,834
but I think we're gonna have
to hand over the stage

1371
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:37,767
to the next--next set.
