00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,710
Hi, I’m Arne, from the Chrome Web Store
team. I’m here to talk about some of the

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,980
reasons we started working on the concept
of web apps for Chrome, and the ways that

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,170
you as a developer can get started writing
these apps.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,419
The idea for a web store grew out of an observation
that the way the web works has changed significantly

5
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:25,560
in the past few years. New standards such
as HTML5 give developers more flexibility

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,720
in the types of experiences the web can provide.
The pace of browser development has also sped

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,230
up, so these new features are shipped to end
users a lot faster than they were in the past.

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,040
Developers have used these new features to
write increasingly sophisticated sites. So,

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,110
the idea of a web site as a place to consume
text-based content has become out of date.

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,850
Developers are writing websites to act as
real-time email clients, listen to streaming

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,170
music, and play multi-player games - functionality
that is traditionally associated with desktop

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,350
apps. Many of Google’s own services push
the limits of what can be done on a web page.

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,239
Tools like Gmail, Docs and Maps are quintessential
web “apps” that use the browser as an

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,820
application platform instead of a content
renderer.

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,329
We believe that the web has reached a point
where these kinds of apps are only going to

16
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,520
become more ubiquitous.  We wanted to make
the experience of launching an app quick and

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,670
direct, just like a desktop application.
So we’ve retooled Chrome’s New Tab page

18
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,499
to display a list of your most commonly used
apps as a series of big beautiful icons, so

19
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:30,280
that getting to the apps you love is as quick
as possible.

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,229
A lot of the new HTML5 features like geolocation
and notifications help make apps very powerful

21
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,039
but at the same time require explicit permission
from the user. A complex app may need lots

22
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:45,579
of these features, which leads to a bad experience,
if the user has to click on a bunch of approval

23
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:51,030
boxes before being able to use the app. To
address this, we made apps require an explicit

24
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,249
“install” flow.  When a user decides
to install an app, they will be presented

25
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,499
with the permissions that the app requires
in an easy to understand list.  When they

26
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,600
approve the permissions, then the app will
be installed to and launched from the New

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,619
Tab page.
Finally, while we think Google search is the

28
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,000
best way to find sites on the web, we understand
that users use many more metrics when selecting

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,819
apps to use. So we built the Chrome Web Store
as a dynamic gallery. Users filter apps by

30
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,650
category, read reviews and ratings and even
get personalized recommendations of apps to

31
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,129
try.
The Chrome Web Store is integrated with the

32
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,629
Chrome browser, so it it easy to access directly
from the New Tab page.

33
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,900
It also offers an integration with Google
Checkout, so if an app requires payment to

34
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,950
use, the buying process is straightforward,
without the user needing to input a credit

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,569
card for each purchase.
One important point to note is that while

36
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,920
we added additional UI and functionality to
support apps in Chrome, we didn’t add any

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,620
additional proprietary APIs or technologies
to learn. Web apps in the Chrome Web Store

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,140
are built using the same standards-based tools
that you would use to create any other website.

39
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,760
In fact, any website can be deployed as an
app simply by filling out a simple manifest

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,670
file and uploading it to the Web Store.
Apps that require payment can take advantage

41
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,640
of open technologies such as OpenID and OAuth
to interact with our license server, or they

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,290
can use any other existing payment or user
infrastructure if they wish.

43
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,200
The key difference, then, is more about how
a web app should be designed, than how it

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,400
is built.  We expect web apps to deliver
a tight focus and a rich user experience.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,650
 In this sense a web app in the store should
be more like a mobile application designed

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,060
for a larger screen, rather than a packaged
installable website.  And because apps can

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,120
use all of the features supported by Google
Chrome, they can be fast, dynamic and powerful

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,859
without having to worry about legacy compatibility.
Hopefully this video has gotten you excited

49
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,030
to try creating a web app of your own and
posting it to the store. There’s an easy

50
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,739
learning curve to get started, and if you
already use a developer channel version of

51
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,409
Chrome and have a text editor, you have all
the software you need to get started. Just

52
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,849
visit code.google.com/chrome/apps to read
tutorials and documentation on building apps.

53
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:04,510
Happy coding!
