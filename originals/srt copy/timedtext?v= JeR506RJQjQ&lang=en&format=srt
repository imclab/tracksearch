1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,420
BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,510
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,340
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,860
has asked this question.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,727
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,200
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is,
primarily, a question and

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,910
answer show, so if any
of you out there

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,160
would like to ask questions.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,990

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,460
TODD KERPELMAN: And we're
live, I think.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,370
Our monitor is broken
so I don't know.

13
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,870
WOLFF DOBSON: Unless we're on
a YouTube stream, at which

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,070
point we're not live at all.

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,140
TODD KERPELMAN: So I'm
Todd Kerpelman.

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm here with Colt McAnlis,
Wolff Dobson, John McCutchan.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,930
We're here actually talking
about what happened to Google

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,190
Games chat number one.

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,670
COLT MCANLIS: Last week.

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,400
TODD KERPELMAN: Which--

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,500
WOLFF DOBSON: Where did it go?

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,880
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

23
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,460
TODD KERPELMAN: Unfortunately--

25
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,770
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Where was it?

26
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,410
TODD KERPELMAN: --it took
YouTube an awfully long time

27
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,210
to process.

28
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,640
So I think it just went
up yesterday.

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
And the ending got cut off,
which was the best part, those

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,390
of you who didn't see it.

31
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,480
It was totally the best part.

32
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,210
COLT MCANLIS: And There was--

33
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,400
if you were following the ticket
YouTube actually said

34
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,110
the problem was there was too
much awesome in it and--

35
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,970
WOLFF DOBSON: They couldn't
compress awesome well enough.

36
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,480
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah,
we don't have--

37
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,420
WOLFF DOBSON: To fit inside
the bit rate.

38
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,600
COLT MCANLIS: At Google.

39
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,850
WOLFF DOBSON: Do we know
anybody at YouTube?

40
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,140

41
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,020
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess we'll
find out after this.

42
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,400
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

43
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,358
TODD KERPELMAN: When we
get angry emails.

44
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,380
COLT MCANLIS: We'll get an
email here in a minute.

45
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,150
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually it's
too bad because we were-- that

46
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,740
was when we were just getting
into the interesting

47
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,140
discussions and we can--
we'll bring that back--

48
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,025
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
I think we should.

49
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,360
TODD KERPELMAN: --for the
beginning of this talk of,

50
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,480
basically, how do you prevent,
particularly, in a JavaScript

51
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,320
kind of game, how do you prevent
clients from cheating?

52
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,120
How do you prevent someone from,
basically, putting in a

53
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,780
little break point in Chrome and
changing things around and

54
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,940
sort of screwing around
with your game code?

55
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,340
And I think where we netted out
that last time was, you

56
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,330
really can't.

57
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,020
That's--

58
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,690
WOLFF DOBSON: Well it doesn't
on what you think is

59
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,550
compromisable and
what you don't.

60
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,210
Ultimately, any client
is compromisable.

61
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,400
If it's sitting on somebody's
desk they're going to be able

62
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,030
to change it.

63
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,680
There are famous examples of in
Halo where they were using

64
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,930
bridges to run the ethernet
packets through.

65
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,370
And then they were intercepting
packets and

66
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,540
changing them or reading them.

67
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,080
They were--

68
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,640
they eventually--

69
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,440
I think they had to run
around and find delay.

70
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,840
And then accuse people-- it's
like, oh you have too much

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,320
delay and lag, you must be using
one of these lag cheat

72
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
fixer things.

73
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,780
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So
this was done on

74
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,630
the server side though?

75
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,360
WOLFF DOBSON: Well no.

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,830
So people, because the
old Halo had ran--

77
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,830
the servers were on
people's boxes.

78
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,870
Like they had--

79
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, P2P.

80
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,030
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

81
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,430
So in the P2P people put bridges
and their PC would

82
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,115
actually catch incoming packets
and change the and

83
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,140
send them back out again.

84
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,560
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's ingenius.

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,260
WOLFF DOBSON: You're
looking terrifying.

86
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,770
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh my gosh.

87
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,640
WOLFF DOBSON: You're
looking terrified.

88
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,310
TODD KERPELMAN: That's--

89
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,910
WOLFF DOBSON: They
can do that.

90
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,060
TODD KERPELMAN: The amount
of effort that is put in.

91
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,610
WOLFF DOBSON: Hey.

92
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,010
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah?

93
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,490
WOLFF DOBSON: Do you want
to win at Halo?

94
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,180
I want to win at Halo.

95
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,640
TODD KERPELMAN: Apparently
not that badly.

96
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,030
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's a
competitive sport.

97
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,190
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

98
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,210
Well it sort of is.

99
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,520
I mean--

100
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,200
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't know.

101
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,690
WOLFF DOBSON: If 13-year-olds
shouting at you over the

102
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,950
internet, you want
to beat them.

103
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,790
TODD KERPELMAN: But I think
even if there's no kind of

104
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,930
mess around with network
packets, you have the issue of

105
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,310
guys like Colt making auto
players for games that play

106
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,030
them perfectly.

107
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,480
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

108
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,710
That got cut off of
the last chat.

109
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,510
TODD KERPELMAN: That
did get cut off.

110
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,610
COLT MCANLIS: I guess I
should fill you in.

111
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,850
So at the end of last chat they
were talking about what

112
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,910
are we playing right now.

113
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,440
I had to admit that I've been
become slightly addicted to

114
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
Triple Town a while ago.

115
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,280
TODD KERPELMAN: Which
is an awesome game.

116
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,870
COLT MCANLIS: Fantastic game.

117
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,270
And I kind of realized that
there was algorithmic

118
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,600
properties of it.

119
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,360
A little bit towards the
middle of my addiction.

120
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,670
And decided to actually write
a algorithm that would play

121
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,420
the game for me.

122
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:31,760
Right?

123
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,890
Because there's a basic pattern
of match three, get an

124
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,010
upgrade, match three,
get an upgrade.

125
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,450
And so I found this algorithmic
pattern and

126
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,130
actually wrote an AI that would
actually play the thing

127
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,320
for me, and actually find
the proper places to put

128
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,315
everything to maximize
the number of castles

129
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,330
on my four by four.

130
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,683
WOLFF DOBSON: Because, you know,
if you have fun, you

131
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:48,170
need to optimize it out.

132
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,010
That's what I'm saying.

133
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,590
COLT MCANLIS: To me it was an
algorithmic challenge, right.

134
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,190
I mean once you kind of get to
the point you've got the

135
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,320
algorithm together then I
actually stopped caring,

136
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,882
because I was like I solved this
and then one day I woke

137
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,360
up in the morning and I was
like, wait a minute.

138
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,050
It works on a 16 by 16.

139
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,810
But what if it was like a
million by a million?

140
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,210
And so then I actually had to
re-engineer the algorithm to

141
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,260
run everything in JavaScript
to try to find how many

142
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,635
castles I could put in a million
by a million and then

143
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:10,230
have that data.

144
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,820
WOLFF DOBSON: Did you use
Google Compute Engine?

145
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,350
COLT MCANLIS: I didn't.

146
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,950
WOLFF DOBSON: Its
700,000 cores.

147
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,510
COLT MCANLIS: I should have.

148
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,810
I really should have.

149
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,820
That's next, actually.

150
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,589
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

151
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,990
Use all of Google's
infrastructure to be one giant

152
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,120
Triple Town.

153
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,380
TODD KERPELMAN: That,
that would be cool.

154
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,500
COLT MCANLIS: I hate
those bears.

155
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,490
TODD KERPELMAN: The
bears are--

156
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,910
WOLFF DOBSON: We have bears
lose on the internet.

157
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,660
TODD KERPELMAN: They--

158
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,550
yeah, the bears are
frustrating.

159
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,510
WOLFF DOBSON: I love
the bears.

160
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,140
They're so cute.

161
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,000
TODD KERPELMAN: Really?

162
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,790
TODD KERPELMAN: The
ninja bears.

163
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,180
You just can't plane for them
and I have no defense against

164
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,690
them beyond--

165
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,230
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh,
they're so cute.

166
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,120
TODD KERPELMAN: --saving the
bots for the times that the

167
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,930
bears, the ninja bears
do come up.

168
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Coming
back to cheating.

169
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,230
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm sorry.

170
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think the
message here is that, like

171
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,300
there's always been cheating if
you go back to the earliest

172
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,750
video game consoles, there's
been mechanisms to cheat and

173
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,620
inflate your score.

174
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,150
So social pressures and server
checks can go a long way.

175
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,400
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

176
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,490
I think that's really you're
only-- especially in

177
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,450
situations like Colt where you
can't really detect between a

178
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,400
player who just happens to be
really good and an algorithm.

179
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,820
At some point you're going to
know if you say, hey, anyone

180
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,600
that gets higher than this
score is going to be a

181
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,080
cheater, you will probably get
some of those cheaters, but

182
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,060
you're also going to get one or
two legitimate players who

183
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,300
are probably your biggest fans
who have probably put money in

184
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,790
your game, and all of
sudden you've banned

185
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,940
them for being cheaters.

186
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,355
And all the cheaters are going
to do is when you say, hey, a

187
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,290
million points or more you must
be cheater, they're going

188
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,560
to set their games to
play to 900,999.

189
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,710
And you're going to kind of keep
going back and forth in

190
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,340
this sort of arms race
that never ends.

191
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

192
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,820
And I think one of things we
mentioned last time, which

193
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,680
probably didn't make it into
the broadcast, was

194
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,035
one, if you look at--

195
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,760
oh, shoot.

196
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,770
Space Camp.

197
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,380
If you look at Space Camp
and whenever which--

198
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,660
this is what we said last time,
oh my gosh, Space Camp.

199
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So good.

200
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,730
COLT MCANLIS: Go buy
Space Camp now.

201
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Play
Space Camp.

202
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,120
COLT MCANLIS: We'll wait.

203
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,030
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

204
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,190
Hit pause, go download Space
Camp, come back.

205
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,020
One of the things that Space
Camp that's really neat is

206
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,310
that they have a graph that you
get at the end of each one

207
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,470
of your plays that gives you a
histogram on where you are in

208
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,810
relationship to other people
who have done that level.

209
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,100
And what it does is it gives
you a chance to--

210
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,030
it gives you, sorry we
just got ourselves a

211
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,630
bit slightly delayed.

212
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,590
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's weird.

213
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,360
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm like,
weird looking at me.

214
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,390
It's

215
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Great.

216
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,020
WOLFF DOBSON: There we go.

217
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
very delayed.

218
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,460
WOLFF DOBSON: So it gives
you this histogram.

219
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,530
And the histogram
allows you to--

220
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,720
OK, we probably--

221
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,620
can we--

222
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,630
TODD KERPELMAN: It's a
little distracting.

223
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

224
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,980
COLT MCANLIS: Look
at the camera.

225
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,700
You're supposed to look
at the camera.

226
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,080
WOLFF DOBSON: I know.

227
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm looking at the camera.

228
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,000
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh,
I'm drinking.

229
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,290
Wait.

230
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,270
No I'm not.

231
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,920
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's move on.

232
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,150
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry.

233
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,630
There's a histogram and the
histogram tells you are you

234
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,710
doing well relative
to other people.

235
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,460
So it's not a high score
list where cheaters

236
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,030
are going to win.

237
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,480
All it really tells you is,
I'm doing pretty well or I

238
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,180
should go back and do this again
to see if it's better.

239
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,980
And I think that is absolutely
cool beyond the fact that

240
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,990
Space Camp is really cool.

241
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

242
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,070
It really changes the high
score table from being an

243
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,270
absolute measurement to being
a relative measurement.

244
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,090
Which cheaters can still skew.

245
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,660
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

246
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,160
But that's going to
happen anyway.

247
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,312
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

248
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:19,980
TODD KERPELMAN: And
I'm all about the

249
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,770
social leader boards.

250
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,690
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

251
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,960
TODD KERPELMAN: A global leader
board, it's going to be

252
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,350
full of cheaters and it's just
going to frustrate anyone that

253
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,810
looks at it.

254
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,300
But a social leader board if
you've got one guy, life Colt,

255
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,680
that's at the top who--

256
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,130
COLT MCANLIS: I like
how we keep

257
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,250
calling it the Colt situation.

258
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,440
Like this guy over here.

259
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The cheater.

260
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,450
COLT MCANLIS: The cheater.

261
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,750
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

262
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,096
The cheater.

263
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:37,790
COLT MCANLIS: It was
an algorithm.

264
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,580
I'm a programmer.

265
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,250
I program.

266
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,002
That's what I do.

267
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,120
TODD KERPELMAN: And I might
remove you from my gamers

268
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,240
circles or something.

269
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, but global
leader boards are incredibly

270
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,300
frustrating.

271
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,350
Especially for me who maybe
is not the best

272
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,570
at some games but--

273
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,670
WOLFF DOBSON: Maybe you need to
join one of those StarCraft

274
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,800
teams that can click more than
2,000 times per second.

275
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,830
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: When I look at
the high score table and I see

276
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:06,880
that I am 250,000 down the
list it's discouraging.

277
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,640
WOLFF DOBSON: There is some
argument that this is part of

278
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,560
what killed arcades
that you went to.

279
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,400
There were a lot of things
that were pushing on the

280
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,750
arcades in the '80s
and '90s that--

281
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,640
where people want to
play and gather--

282
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,080
but part of it is that they
network the high score lists.

283
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,130
And all a sudden like three guys
in Seattle were the only

284
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,210
people who were getting on the
high score list anywhere.

285
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,860
And everybody else was
like, why am I even

286
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,820
playing this game?

287
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,450
But when it was-- you'd go down
there and you'd see seven

288
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,120
people you didn't really know,
but they were all the people

289
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,010
who played Street Fighter at
lunch on Thursdays and then

290
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,280
you had somebody to play with.

291
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,450
And there was a local ranking
that you could beat.

292
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,530
But as soon as there
was this other--

293
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I guess I missed
the networking of high

294
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,179
score tables.

295
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,940
You couldn't just unplug the
box and plug it back in?

296
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,420
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, exactly.

297
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,120
COLT MCANLIS: See.

298
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,480
He's cheater too.

299
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,070
Not just me.

300
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,650
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm just
leveling the playing field.

301
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,670
COLT MCANLIS: It's all
the NaCl guys.

302
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,780
WOLFF DOBSON: The social
people just want

303
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,785
us all to get along.

304
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,460
COLT MCANLIS: The NaCl guys
are just aggressive.

305
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

306
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,590
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

307
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,770
TODD KERPELMAN: So, anyway,
let's move on.

308
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,670
Let's--

309
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,500
so I think that kind of pretty
much caught up where

310
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,190
we were last time.

311
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,940
We talked a little bit about
what games we were playing,

312
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,310
but we can talk about
that later.

313
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,080
We never really talked too much
about game related apps

314
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,970
and hang outs.

315
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,650
One most interesting I think
has been Tabletop Forge.

316
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:19,930
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

317
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,930
TODD KERPELMAN: Which is, I
guess, not so much a game

318
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,570
itself as a--

319
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,470
WOLFF DOBSON: As a platform
for playing games on.

320
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,760
Yeah.

321
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,650
It's really neat.

322
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,710
They have a wonderful story
that goes with it too.

323
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,760
Where they--

324
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,260
they were two guys who were in
different places who working

325
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,220
together, who were working
separately, on apps that would

326
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,130
sort of support playing Dungeons
and Dragons and other

327
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,170
RPGs in Hangouts.

328
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,430
And then they sort of realized
on the internet, oh, hey,

329
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,590
we're working on the same thing,
we should join forces.

330
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,260
So they joined forces and people
really twigged to it.

331
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,960
And then they ran
a Kickstarter.

332
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,360
And they were like, hey, if
you guys gave us a little

333
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,000
money we could really
make this good.

334
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,150
And the Kickstarter went big
and then eventually got on

335
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,390
Penny Arcade, which just
exploded after that.

336
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,050
And they're out there.

337
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,200
If you look for Tabletop Forge
on Google+ they've got their

338
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,230
own page, you can download
the app.

339
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,100
I think they're still running
a new kick starter for even

340
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,710
more features.

341
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,770
And you get cool custom tiles
and stuff if you--

342
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,770
but that I think is
really exciting.

343
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,010
And I think it's a neat way to
use Hangouts because, as we're

344
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,770
talking about cheating,
cheating in

345
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,800
RPGs is sort of silly.

346
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,330
To be like, I have a plus--

347
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:31,900
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm 120!

348
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,950
WOLFF DOBSON: --175 sword.

349
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,570
But within Hangouts you have
social pressure to sort of

350
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,360
keep it reasonable.

351
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,610
The people you're playing with,
your friends, are going

352
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,210
to hold you in into playing
in a legitimate way.

353
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,920
I think that's neat too.

354
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,180
I'm really excited about it.

355
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,360
I have friends that I role
play with, but incredibly

356
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,100
rarely, because we're not
co-located very well.

357
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,500
COLT MCANLIS: Are you the
lightning bolt guy?

358
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,390
WOLFF DOBSON: Lightning bolt.

359
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,860
Fruit.

360
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,410
No.

361
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,640
No, I'm just, I'm a
reluctant paladin.

362
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,630
I've been chosen by the gods
and I really don't want the

363
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,500
responsibility.

364
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,900
It's not unlike my real life.

365
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,670

366
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,500
So, yeah, that's what's
going on there.

367
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,810
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

368
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,300
WOLFF DOBSON: Hopefully there's
going to be all kinds

369
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,730
of new stuff.

370
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,560
We have 8 Ball Pool and a few
other things that are playable

371
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,120
now that you should check out.

372
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,230
COLT MCANLIS: So you brought up
an interesting point there,

373
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,410
and I want to get the panel's
view on this.

374
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,320
There's actually been a pretty
healthy trend lately for both

375
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,070
professional and amateur game
developers coming out on

376
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,380
Kickstarter and asking for--

377
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,300
putting up a game plan, putting
a business decision,

378
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,340
actually asking for money
to move forward with.

379
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,100
This has got a lot
of attention.

380
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,330
More attention than some
people ever estimated.

381
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,280
In fact, Gabe Newell came out
a while ago, before this

382
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,580
phenomenon, came out and
actually mentioned that he

383
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,020
believes one of the future ways
to do game development

384
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,780
may be consumer funded.

385
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,970
So the question for you guys is,
how big of an ecosystem do

386
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,620
you see this?

387
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,880
How long do you see
the tail on this?

388
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,240
Do you actually see
this happening?

389
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,100
I haven't really seen any
of the games come out.

390
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,260
I haven't seen, besides the guys
over at Double Fine, I

391
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,010
haven't really seen a lot of
established game developers

392
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,410
coming out and using
this medium.

393
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,710
What are guys' thoughts
on this?

394
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,780
WOLFF DOBSON: Well I think one
of the big pieces of news was

395
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,970
Penny Arcade, not to bring them
up again, but they just

396
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,640
had a Kickstarter saying hey,
let's work on the stuff that

397
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,210
we want to work on and get rid
of ads off the front page.

398
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,160
And they didn't quite make it.

399
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,750
They got enough money, they
said, I think yesterday, they

400
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,900
got enough money to remove the
top ad from their thing.

401
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,800
And then they're still probably
going to do the

402
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,110
project they were kickstarting
even though they didn't quite

403
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,490
reach their goal to do it.

404
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The Lookouts.

405
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,470
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

406
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,940
The Daughters of the Forest
I think [INAUDIBLE].

407
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,130
COLT MCANLIS: Which is cool.

408
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:42,880
WOLFF DOBSON: Which is cool.

409
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,100
COLT MCANLIS: That's
super-cool.

410
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,130
WOLFF DOBSON: But, yeah, that's
been an interesting

411
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,170
phenomenon.

412
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,810
There's the Leisure Suit Larry
guys who are rebooting Leisure

413
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,160
Suit Larry using Kickstarter.

414
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,670
COLT MCANLIS: So, but I
mean, do you think--

415
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,550
so here's a problem right.

416
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,960
You get a lot of developers and
you can come in and the

417
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,200
way, my understanding of the
way Kickstarter works is,

418
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,050
effectively, this money is sort
of pledged to you ahead

419
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,250
of time and then you're
kind of given this--

420
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,090
I'm not sure what the
restrictions are versus the

421
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,620
lending company to you as an
individual and where the money

422
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,740
goes, but effectively there's
not a lot of checks and

423
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,530
balances involved as
far as product

424
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,370
management is concerned.

425
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,516
To assure the product actually
reaches the public.

426
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,210
That you're actually
going to do it.

427
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,510
You don't get a-- it's not like
having a VC-funded system

428
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,050
where you get some dude sitting
in you cubicle--

429
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,930
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

430
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,560
As consumers we don't end
up on their board.

431
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,460
I think is what you're saying.

432
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:31,930
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, exactly.

433
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,560
We really have no ability to
hold them liable for our

434
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,950
potential investment.

435
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,220
Right?

436
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Personally I've
been very skeptical of

437
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,610
most Kickstarter projects.

438
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,570
There's been a few that
I've been tempted by.

439
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,250
I'm like, oh, if this actually
came out I would

440
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,090
buy it in an instant.

441
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,800
And I've always just decided,
well, when it does come out, I

442
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,540
will buy it.

443
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,300
And avoid the risk.

444
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,050
WOLFF DOBSON: Well
when I was--

445
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,080
I just had back surgery recently
and when I was on the

446
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,460
painkillers I went
to Kickstarter

447
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,710
and did some damage.

448
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,800

449
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,460
COLT MCANLIS: I'm sorry buddy,
that sounds like a new

450
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,580
advertising campaign
for [INAUDIBLE].

451
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,230
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

452
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,885
COLT MCANLIS: On painkillers?

453
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:09,785
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

454
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,330
WOLFF DOBSON: Painkillers
and Kickstarter.

455
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,120
Perfect together.

456
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,421
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Post-surgery?

457
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:13,892
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

458
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:15,142
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Check us out.

459
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:18,400

460
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,950
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess I--

461
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,500
COLT MCANLIS: I think you just
closed the thread on this one.

462
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,640
What's your thoughts
on Kickstarter?

463
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,455
Well, take some quaaludes.

464
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:25,950
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

465
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,780
On industrial painkillers,
horse

466
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,520
tranquilizer, it works great.

467
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There has been a
few projects that seems very

468
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,110
tempting to me, but I've read
some pretty rough postmortems

469
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,420
of people who've got Kickstarter
money and promised

470
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,830
too many gifts and freebies to
the donators and ended up,

471
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,840
after collecting a few hundred
thousand dollars, ended up

472
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,450
with $20,000 to actually
build the game with.

473
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,170
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

474
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,210
I've actually heard that, and
some of the products that I've

475
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,030
supported have, they've
sort of admitted that.

476
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,020
I think we went a little
crazy with the gifts.

477
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

478
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,310
Yeah.

479
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,880
And lawyer fees and taxes.

480
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,010
There's a lot of things that
people aren't factoring in,

481
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,600
and so maybe it's the developers
responsibility to

482
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,690
kind of educate them as to what
percentage of Kickstarter

483
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,190
money are they actually
going to end up with.

484
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,000
COLT MCANLIS: And I think, to
be very modern about this

485
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,480
stuff, I think that's where a
lot of criticism comes for the

486
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,670
new OUYA console is OK, fine.

487
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,120
So you've made x amount
of money.

488
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,770
Cut that in half and that's
actually what you're going to

489
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,570
walk away with in
terms of taxes.

490
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,355
Right?

491
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:35,770
And then how many of that
is going to produce

492
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,640
in number of units.

493
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,435
There's manufacturing
costs, there's

494
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:39,970
all these other things.

495
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,067
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
FCC licensing, all

496
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:41,550
that kind of stuff.

497
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,200
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

498
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,890
There's a massive amount of
money overhead that's not

499
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,630
being accounted for.

500
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,590
So now Double Fine I think did
a great job with this too.

501
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,990
Is they've already come out
and said, hey, Kickstarter

502
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,410
wasn't our only funding.

503
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,260
They kind of used that as their
springboard to then go

504
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,580
get funding from other people.

505
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,220
And, now, if OUYA is going that
route, I think that's

506
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,920
very valuable.

507
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,120
But it's a perfect example of
hey, we're only going to have

508
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,700
enough money to make 1,000
units the first batch.

509
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,010
Right?

510
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,530
And then trying to talk to game
developers about hey,

511
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,760
let's get you on 1,000 units and
get that out to the people

512
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,340
so you can make money.

513
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,790
That's a really difficult
discussion.

514
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,210
TODD KERPELMAN: It does help
solve some of the traction

515
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,040
problem, right.

516
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,510
Of like--

517
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,100
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

518
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,390
TODD KERPELMAN: --no one wants
to give you money until you've

519
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,670
demonstrated traction.

520
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,040
And you can't really demonstrate
traction until

521
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
you've spent a bunch of time
building product, which you

522
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,582
can't do because you have no
money because no one will give

523
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:32,570
it to you because you
don't have traction.

524
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,610
So I think Kickstarter can
be really useful for

525
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,740
demonstrating there's at least
100,000 people out there who

526
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,180
have been willing to give me
$10 to get an early preview

527
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,580
copy of this game.

528
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,550
So clearly there's some sort
of market for this.

529
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,520
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Maybe if we
took the name of the site

530
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,390
literally as a kick starter.

531
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,380
Maybe it's doing its
job right there.

532
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,540
Right?

533
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,140
Giving projects some legs, so
that they can go out and get a

534
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,430
significant amount of money.

535
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,470
TODD KERPELMAN: But not the site
that you should go to to

536
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,480
fully fund your project.

537
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,735
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

538
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:01,090
TODD KERPELMAN: It could be.

539
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,290
COLT MCANLIS: So really the four
of us need to make a post

540
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,520
Kickstarter site where, once
you've got your Kickstarter

541
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,560
money, you come to us and we'll
give you VC capital and

542
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,450
then you can go the
rest of the way.

543
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,480
And then that'll get the angry
guys sitting in your cubicle

544
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,710
ensuring that you'll
hit your milestone.

545
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The 1,000
console, sorry

546
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,170
1,000 units, right?

547
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,530
That's not enough.

548
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,150
The number that I've always
heard is six million.

549
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,270
Six million is enough to get
video game publishers

550
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,155
interested in producing content
for your platform.

551
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:32,640
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, so you're
talking about the buy-in.

552
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,470
I thought, six million
copies of the game?

553
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,400
Holy moly!

554
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,930
That would be awesome.

555
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,206
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No.

556
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:40,380
Six million pieces of hardware
before it becomes relevant to

557
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,360
large publishers--

558
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,700
TODD KERPELMAN: I mean, I think
if we're talking about

559
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,060
the OUYA specifically, or--

560
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

561
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,320
TODD KERPELMAN: I thought
it was oooya.

562
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,290
I mean, you know--

563
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,480
WOLFF DOBSON: It's all vowels.

564
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
TODD KERPELMAN: That, my
impression of it is that, you

565
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,040
don't have to essentially build
a new game from scratch.

566
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,470
There are some modifications
you make to a game that's

567
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,660
available on Android.

568
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,290
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Sure.

569
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:00,700
Yeah.

570
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,190
TODD KERPELMAN: And you--

571
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,390
to take advantage of the new
interface and the actual--

572
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:05,840
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Controller.

573
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,090
TODD KERPELMAN: --controller
and all that.

574
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,745
It's not like, oh, OK, now I'm
building for a PlayStation 3.

575
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:12,110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

576
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,510
Yeah.

577
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,120
Well, and PlayStation 3 has
pretty heavy technical debt

578
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,880
that you have to go into.

579
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,850
TODD KERPELMAN: The other
thing I will say about

580
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,540
Kickstarter is that I think
it's interesting that--

581
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,770
and maybe it's just because this
is all the news I read--

582
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,920
but I think it's interesting
that most the projects that

583
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,700
seemed to have been successful,
or at least gotten

584
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,290
the most funding, or have taken
off have all been games

585
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,720
related, for the most part.

586
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,480
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think one
of the other ones that's

587
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,180
been pretty successful
is hardware.

588
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,055
There's the Watch guys and OUYA
and things like this.

589
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,060
TODD KERPELMAN: The
gaming VR device.

590
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,480
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah

591
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,730
TODD KERPELMAN: That
think looks cool.

592
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,110
WOLFF DOBSON: It
does look cool.

593
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah
it does look cool.

594
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,170
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm like him.

595
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,940
As soon as they have one.

596
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,330
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

597
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,240
I'll jump on it as soon
as it's for sale.

598
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,490
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

599
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,640

600
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,510
I can tell a story where
I there was--

601
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,800
I think there's one other
emotional moment where

602
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,120
Kickstarter can be good.

603
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,940
And that's where you as a fan
are putting your money down to

604
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,890
say like, I really want this.

605
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,932
I think that's like Double Fine
saying, I want point and

606
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:16,260
click adventures again,
or whatever, however

607
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,020
they phrased it.

608
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,580
Or an album.

609
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm $10 into this album.

610
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,290
I did a Kickstarter
for MC Frontalot.

611
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,780
I was like, I want--

612
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,430
I have been listening to your
music for free for so long, if

613
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,590
there's some way I can give you
$5, $10, $15 I'm there.

614
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,920
And I put my money down and I
got my early access to videos.

615
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
I felt like a good fan.

616
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,770
And it was really fun.

617
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,760
I was really tempted
to do the--

618
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,340
one of the rewards was you can
spend thousands of dollars and

619
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,890
he'll show up in your
living room and rap.

620
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,510
Which I thought that would have
been pretty awesome too.

621
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,275
COLT MCANLIS: Was this on the
painkillers or off the

622
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:48,670
painkillers?

623
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,830
WOLFF DOBSON: This is well
before the painkillers.

624
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,030
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

625
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,080
OK.

626
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,550
I got to make sure I understand
where the

627
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,000
conversation is going to.

628
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,160
WOLFF DOBSON: No, no.

629
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,550
MC Frontalot is great.

630
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,480
And actually I don't know if
you guys remember-- this is

631
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,460
going to date me a little bit--
there's a game called

632
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,520
Fool's Errand.

633
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,010
Anybody remember that?

634
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,640
It was on the old puzzle game
that came out on the Mac.

635
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
It was on the Mac Plus.

636
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,480
I played it when I was
in high school.

637
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,940
It was incredibly,
incredibly old.

638
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,920
It was brilliant.

639
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,190
It was all these little puzzles
stuck together and you

640
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,910
sort of assembled into
some big meta puzzle

641
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,320
that you had to solve.

642
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,530
And we spent hours playing
this game.

643
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,626
And of course we pirated it
because we were high school

644
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,930
and college students--

645
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,480
and--

646
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,930
TODD KERPELMAN: Which
we do not endorse.

647
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,820
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
here's the thing.

648
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,810
So I felt really guilty about
it because I had so much--

649
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Here comes
the endorsement.

650
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,460
WOLFF DOBSON: I had so
much fun with it.

651
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,490
I had so much with the game and
Cliff Johnson, who's the

652
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,310
guy who I searched for him with
Google at one point, and

653
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,480
I came across this site.

654
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,620
And it turns out he's actually
making a sequel called A Fool

655
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,610
and His Money.

656
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,620
And there's all these auction
games built into it, as well

657
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,680
as all his regular puzzles.

658
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,710
And he was soliciting
pre-sales.

659
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,840
This was before Kickstarter.

660
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,550
This was five years ago.

661
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,960
Soliciting pre-sales.

662
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,580
And he was like, it's
going to be whatever

663
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,830
it is, $29 or whatever.

664
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,500
And I was like, sign me up.

665
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,020
I owe you this money from so
long ago, with interest.

666
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,670
This is great.

667
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,430
I put my money down.

668
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,580
I realize there's some irony
in a game called The

669
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,860
Fool and His Money.

670
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,880
This is the game that I put
down money in advance on.

671
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,850
I have not seen that game yet.

672
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,070
But I don't care.

673
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,580
Because as a fan I felt
like I was supporting.

674
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,905
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The
guy is amazing.

675
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:24,960
WOLFF DOBSON: It's brilliant.

676
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,990
COLT MCANLIS: He
just went meta.

677
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,962
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

678
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:27,450
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

679
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,420
Yeah, exactly.

680
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,130
It's some kind of
performance art.

681
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,840
He sends this email about once
every six months saying,

682
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,800
really soon now.

683
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,240
Really, really soon now.

684
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,595
I'm still looking
forward to it.

685
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,172
COLT MCANLIS: A guy in Nigeria
sends me those emails.

686
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,020
About once a month.

687
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,350
WOLFF DOBSON: Have you
finally gotten your

688
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,220
transfer of a $150,000?

689
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,420
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No,
but it's soon.

690
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,030
WOLFF DOBSON: Directly
into your account.

691
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,510
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's really,
really soon.

692
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,920
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

693
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,220
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

694
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,330
COLT MCANLIS: The government's
sanctioning it.

695
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,520
That's the problem.

696
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
We got some time left for
questions, right?

697
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,950
TODD KERPELMAN: We do.

698
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,140
And I think, depending on how
long we want to run--

699
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,970
we never actually determined if
this is a half hour or 45

700
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,510
minute show.

701
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,310
COLT MCANLIS: Should we ask
that guy over there?

702
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,365
TODD KERPELMAN: We
left it vague--

703
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:00,840
COLT MCANLIS: Let's
keep going.

704
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,515
TODD KERPELMAN: --so
that we can.

705
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:03,280
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think
we need to keep going.

706
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,710
I want to talk about games
we've been playing.

707
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,210
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

708
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,210
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

709
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,570
WOLFF DOBSON: I want
to talk about--

710
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,200
I just want on vacation with
my Nexus 7, and I--

711
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,645
COLT MCANLIS: To Alaska.

712
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:12,090
WOLFF DOBSON: To Alaska.

713
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,720
COLT MCANLIS: To Alaska.

714
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh,
that's right.

715
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,290
WOLFF DOBSON: That--

716
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,660
there was some unfortunate
moose comment.

717
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,820
I did in fact see a moose.

718
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,440
I saw a moose.

719
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: WiFi hotspot?

720
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,220
WOLFF DOBSON: It was
not a WiFi hotspot.

721
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,320
I was in the middle of Denali
where there was not even a

722
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,890
call signal.

723
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,940
And, in fact, I had trouble.

724
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,010
There's some kind of wacky
WiFi in Alaska.

725
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,240
But once--

726
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,200
it turned out the coffee shops
and, weirdly, the little tiny

727
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,820
hole in the wall places in
Denali, awesome WiFi.

728
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,730

729
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,080
I brought my Nexus 7 and I
basically, I didn't bring my

730
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,900
laptop or anything else,
it was like my entire

731
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,930
entertainment device,
was my Nexus 7.

732
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,280
And I wanted to talk about one
of the games that my daughter

733
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,540
and I just went nuts over.

734
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,480
It was Super Stickman Golf.

735
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,790
I don't know if you guys
have seen that.

736
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,600
It's by Noodlecake Studios.

737
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,150
It is just a wonderful
take on 2-D golf.

738
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,190
It's all platforms and
you're bouncing the

739
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,280
ball up off the platforms.

740
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,710
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh.

741
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,140
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, cool.

742
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,490
WOLFF DOBSON: Really clever.

743
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,950
They switch to a free model and
they have a micro payments

744
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,350
where you can buy power
ups in the thing.

745
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,940
It's a little weird because, I
love this game and you should

746
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,680
all play it, but at the same
time, like a fan, I want to

747
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,170
put my money down, but I don't
really want to buy power ups.

748
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,110
I just want it to be fair.

749
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,800
So, there's an interesting
emotional thing.

750
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,020
So I'm going to buy some power
ups when I get to the point

751
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,490
which I need them.

752
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,280
But it is an interesting
case where I was just

753
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,660
like, I'm a big fan.

754
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,010
Here, $5, $10 whatever
you want.

755
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,580
But instead I'm going to micro
payment my way to--

756
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,220
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So is that
game available on--

757
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,710
WOLFF DOBSON: It's available
on Android.

758
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,470
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All
Android devices?

759
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,770
WOLFF DOBSON: I believe it's
all Android devices.

760
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,100
I'll look right now.

761
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's great.

762
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,090
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

763
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,800
It's really great.

764
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,206
I would-- ooh, I haven't
plus one'd yet.

765
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:48,090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Going to have
to get it for my phone.

766
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,510
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

767
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,400
I would definitely
recommend it.

768
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,080
And it's wonderful
on a tablet.

769
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,074
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Great.

770
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,900
COLT MCANLIS: Especially
the Nexus 7.

771
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,160
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh yeah.

772
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,650
WOLFF DOBSON: Especially
your Nexus 7.

773
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,010
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The Nexus 7.

774
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,955
TODD KERPELMAN: John, what
are you playing?

775
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:02,890
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Let's see.

776
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,560
Lately I've been playing Super
Mario 3D Land actually.

777
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,245
On my 3DS.

778
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:06,570
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

779
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm enjoying
that quite a bit.

780
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,730
And, I know this is going to
be unpopular, but Scramble

781
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,790
with Friends.

782
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,680
WOLFF DOBSON: Scramble
with Friends?

783
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,370
I'm still playing Draw
with Friends.

784
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:16,860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh.

785
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,340
WOLFF DOBSON: Or,
Draw Something.

786
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Draw
Something.

787
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,330
WOLFF DOBSON: Draw Something.

788
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,250
TODD KERPELMAN: Draw
Something?

789
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Scramble with
Friends I can't stop playing.

790
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,310
I'm too competitive.

791
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,590
I have some really
good competition.

792
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,540
WOLFF DOBSON: Did you write an
algorithm using Google Compute

793
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,130
Engine to cheat?

794
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You know how
many times I've been tempted

795
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,620
to just, to go ahead
and do that?

796
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:32,986
COLT MCANLIS: See.

797
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:33,600
See.

798
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm like, OK,
I can just pause this,

799
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,920
transcribe the board onto the
computer and solve it.

800
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
And just dominate.

801
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,790
But I want it to be fair.

802
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,260
TODD KERPELMAN: Because are you
actually playing with real

803
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,770
life friends?

804
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

805
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,556
Yes.

806
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:47,300
WOLFF DOBSON: You're not
playing with robots.

807
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Playing with my
cousin and old friends from

808
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,780
high school.

809
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,500
I don't want to--

810
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,000
TODD KERPELMAN: You don't
want to cheat.

811
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

812
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,690
Exactly.

813
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:52,850
COLT MCANLIS: Wait.

814
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,350
You don't want to cheat?

815
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,980
Playing with your old friends
from high school?

816
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,160
WOLFF DOBSON: I think that's
exactly the moment

817
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,390
which you do cheat.

818
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:57,970
COLT MCANLIS: That's
the exact people.

819
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,198
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

820
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:58,274
No.

821
00:24:58,274 --> 00:24:58,350
No.

822
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,740
COLT MCANLIS: You do cheat all
the way up until the high

823
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,122
school convention.

824
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:00,886
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm sorry old
friends from high school.

825
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:01,720
COLT MCANLIS: Or the reunion.

826
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,060
Right?

827
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,270
Then you have something to talk
about at the convention.

828
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I just
kill at Scramble.

829
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,170
Perfect games.

830
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,300
I don't know how I do it.

831
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,860
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, and also
speaking of puzzle games.

832
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,070
I also played 100 Floors.

833
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,970
That sort of--

834
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,650
COLT MCANLIS: How is that?

835
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,940
WOLFF DOBSON: It's got some
ridiculous number of downloads

836
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,570
on the Play store.

837
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,380
What are they at?

838
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,880
They're like 10 million
or something.

839
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,155
Crazy.

840
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,540
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: How does
the game work?

841
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,940
WOLFF DOBSON: It is sort of
an escape classic 2005

842
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,440
escape the room game.

843
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,680
Where you just kind of have an
interface and you kind of

844
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,080
click around until you
figure it out.

845
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,700
Sometimes--

846
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,460
and it's just, again, it's
like Fool's Errand.

847
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,250
It's this collection of puzzles
and you don't really

848
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,500
know-- each time you look at,
what am I going to do?

849
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,720
Is it motion sensors?

850
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,730
Am I clicking on things?

851
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,480
Is there a code?

852
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,020
And they're--

853
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,430
it does lie a little.

854
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,440
There are only 90 floors
right now.

855
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,130
But it was very disappointing
when I got to 90 and it said,

856
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,610
more coming soon.

857
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,700
Nooo!

858
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,660
COLT MCANLIS: That's
how they get you.

859
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: 90 floors just
didn't have the same ring.

860
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,270
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

861
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,230
WOLFF DOBSON: But it's great.

862
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,733
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
100 [INAUDIBLE].

863
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:04,460
Never mind.

864
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,130
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

865
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Speaking of--

866
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,180
WOLFF DOBSON: If
you have only.

867
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,320
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --old
puzzle games.

868
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,810
Well, kind of new
puzzle games.

869
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,932
I don't know if anyone
played Zack & Wiki?

870
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:13,374
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

871
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,260
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: For the Wii?

872
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,530
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

873
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Man,
that game was good.

874
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,050
WOLFF DOBSON: That was fun.

875
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I wish that--

876
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,120
we need to start a Kickstarter
to get

877
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,010
Capcom to make a sequel.

878
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,920
COLT MCANLIS: I'll put up
the post-Kickstarter--

879
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right.

880
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,340
COLT MCANLIS: --website
for that.

881
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,850
WOLFF DOBSON: You're there.

882
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,210
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

883
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,375
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I wonder
if Kickstarter will

884
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,020
allow you to do that.

885
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,245
To take someone else's
intellectual property and make

886
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:34,210
a Kickstarter to create a
sequel for that game.

887
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,490
Probably not.

888
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,040
WOLFF DOBSON: Wasn't there a
thing where there was the

889
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,420
Flash game that was all the
classic Nintendo and SNES

890
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,050
characters, and then it got
popular enough that they were

891
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,210
like, oh, we should actually
release this as a

892
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,390
downloadable game.

893
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,220
At which point all the
intellectual property stuff

894
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,790
was a problem.

895
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,580
So they now have characters who
are a lot like, but not

896
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,730
quite, [INAUDIBLE]

897
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,370
for these things.

898
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,690
So, yeah, you can do that.

899
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,870
You could have like
Mack and Ricky.

900
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,920
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Mack
and Ricky.

901
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,720
WOLFF DOBSON: Something
like that.

902
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,650
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

903
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,805
WOLFF DOBSON: All right, Colt,
what are you playing?

904
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:06,280
TODD KERPELMAN: What
are you playing?

905
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,730
COLT MCANLIS: I'm actually, with
the hype for the new Team

906
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,900
Fortress 2, Man vs. Machine, I'm
actually getting back into

907
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,570
Team Fortress 2.

908
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,310
I used to do a lot of
competitive first person

909
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,120
shooter gaming back in my
day when I was younger.

910
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,490
And I'm actually getting back
into Team Fortress 2.

911
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,540
I thought it was a really--

912
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
I love TF2.

913
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,090
I love the way they came
out with a style.

914
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,860
They changed it.

915
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,045
They put a lot of atmosphere,
a lot of character into it.

916
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,260
It was a huge departure
from the other FPSs

917
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,890
we've seen at the time.

918
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,490
We're starting-- there was
kind of that period where

919
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,250
everything, every first person
shooter came out with that

920
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,650
gray tint to it.

921
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,730
They came out with bright, vivid
colors, great emotion.

922
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,360
I thought it was fantastic.

923
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,740
It's really fun to get
back into it now that

924
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,230
it's free to play.

925
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,420
It's really cool.

926
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,040
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I keep almost
getting back into it.

927
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,810
I'm just--

928
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,910
I should install this.

929
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,760
It's so much fun.

930
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,310
COLT MCANLIS: It is.

931
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,120
It really is.

932
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,960
And, plus, there's Valve is
adding the robots so we don't

933
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,080
have to write our own now.

934
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,160
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There you go.

935
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,430
Yeah.

936
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,260
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and
you need a hat.

937
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,784
COLT MCANLIS: The sandwich.

938
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:05,990
The sandwich.

939
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,070
WOLFF DOBSON: I always think
that game is just an absolute

940
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,300
triumph of character design.

941
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,980
Among all of the things, I think
they said they wanted to

942
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,445
look like a Winslow
Homer painting.

943
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:14,870
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

944
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,210
WOLFF DOBSON: And it
really-- it's--

945
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,370

946
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,780
I went to downtown San Jose
while they were having and

947
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,700
Fanime, which is the big
anime convention.

948
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,260
And they were also having
graduation for San Jose State,

949
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,470
which meant that it was a really
weird group of people

950
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,940
all mixing together.

951
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Lot
of cosplay.

952
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,450
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

953
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:31,900
There's the thing.

954
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,010
There was all these people
dressed as cosplay, and all

955
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,060
these other people dressed in
their Sunday best all walking

956
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,070
through each other and giving
each other these-- what are

957
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,490
you doing here?

958
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,615
And it was interesting that
when I was walking through

959
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:46,045
there there was tons of Team
Fortress despite the fact that

960
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:47,120
that's not even anime at all.

961
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,020
It's just those characters
are so iconic that they

962
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,207
wanted to do it.

963
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:53,141
COLT MCANLIS: What
about you Todd?

964
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:53,610
What do you play?

965
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,080
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see.

966
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,970
Haven't had a lot of time
to play games the

967
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,615
last week or so.

968
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:57,990
COLT MCANLIS: Oh,
that's right.

969
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,560
You have the new--

970
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,960
TODD KERPELMAN: Got
the new baby.

971
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,840
COLT MCANLIS: You've cloned.

972
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,000
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

973
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,880
I don't remember--

974
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,320
WOLFF DOBSON: It's like
a video game.

975
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,090
And there are a lot
of micro payments.

976
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,620
That's what I'm saying.

977
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,730
COLT MCANLIS: For the
next 20 years.

978
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,470
TODD KERPELMAN: And there's
a lot of crying.

979
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,650
COLT MCANLIS: It's like an
old school NES game.

980
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:12,950
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

981
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,510
COLT MCANLIS: Extremely
difficult and lots of crying.

982
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:14,990
TODD KERPELMAN: Yep.

983
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,860
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

984
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,020
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

985
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,270
Got to be careful you
don't mess up.

986
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,330
I did--

987
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,080
in between all of that, I did,
finally, I defeated Diablo my

988
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,380
first run through on--

989
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,910
COLT MCANLIS: Diablo 3.

990
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,870
TODD KERPELMAN: --Diablo 3.

991
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,630
WOLFF DOBSON: You finally
beat Diablo 1.

992
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,780
Congratulations.

993
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,210
TODD KERPELMAN: No.

994
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,840
Diablo 3.

995
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Where
did you find DOS?

996
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,330

997
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,665
COLT MCANLIS: There's a
Kickstarter project for it

998
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:38,880
apparently.

999
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,410
TODD KERPELMAN: Want to go back
and kind of replay it

1000
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,020
with either a different
character, or the next

1001
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,870
difficulty level, but at the
same time, given my limited

1002
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,830
time for gaming at the moment I
said, I should try something

1003
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,620
completely different.

1004
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,410
And so I have actually have
now installed Skyrim.

1005
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,030
And I think I played--

1006
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,160
actually I played about two
hours of trying to decide

1007
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,620
which mods I want to install
and 1/2 an hour of actually

1008
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,310
game playing.

1009
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,470
WOLFF DOBSON: And at
least 15 minutes of

1010
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,020
tweaking the settings.

1011
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,160
A little shinier, no a
little less shiny.

1012
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,640
A little more, little less.

1013
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,150
TODD KERPELMAN: The mods totally
appeal to my geeky

1014
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:13,090
side of oh, I could get better
looking eyebrows on people.

1015
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,750
But then there's five different
versions of the

1016
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,480
eyebrow variation mod
and I start to--

1017
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,960
WOLFF DOBSON: See, I'm having
flashbacks to playing Mass

1018
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,580
Effect where each Mass Effect
game I had to start four times

1019
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,150
because I kept revising how I
wanted my character to look.

1020
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,670
In Mass Effect 3 I got
way into it and I was

1021
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,860
like, I love this.

1022
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,000
I had my tough thing.

1023
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,180
And then I realized suddenly
that she looked weirdly like

1024
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,470
Michael Jackson.

1025
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,090
I was like, ahhh!

1026
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,500
I had to stop and restart
the game again.

1027
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,040
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Can you
moonwalk in that game?

1028
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,410
WOLFF DOBSON: That character
would have been able to--

1029
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,380
TODD KERPELMAN: Only if they
were in animation.

1030
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,910
WOLFF DOBSON: There's a perk
in there that you can buy.

1031
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,470
TODD KERPELMAN: I always kind
of felt like game developers

1032
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,110
all need to get together and
work on a common standard for

1033
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,210
facial construction.

1034
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,625
Every game, Saints Row,
and Mass Effect, and

1035
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:03,820
Skyrim, and all these.

1036
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,030
There's--

1037
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,740
WOLFF DOBSON: Tiger
Woods Golf.

1038
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:04,836
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

1039
00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:07,850
There's 80 different sliders
how you can get

1040
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,710
your character look.

1041
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,660
And depending on how I'm feeling
I either try and make

1042
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,130
them look as close to me as
possible, or as close to some

1043
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,260
famous person or something.

1044
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,580
WOLFF DOBSON: I was just going
to say, it depends on what's

1045
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,810
going to happen to them.

1046
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,510
Whether I make them look
like Todd or want them

1047
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,430
to look like me.

1048
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,470
Oh, sorry.

1049
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The most
grotesque character you

1050
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,920
possibly can.

1051
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,090
WOLFF DOBSON: That's what
The Sims is for.

1052
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Move all the
sliders to the right.

1053
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,920
TODD KERPELMAN: But then it
would be great if I could keep

1054
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,170
that character designed from
one game to the next.

1055
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,450
So I don't have to recreate me
our Jason Statham or whatever.

1056
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,100
And Tiger Woods.

1057
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,790
WOLFF DOBSON: Jason Statham.

1058
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,440
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would be awesome.

1059
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:43,910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Tiger,
let's go.

1060
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,000
WOLFF DOBSON: Or in my case,
weirdly, Michael Jackson.

1061
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,310
How did I do that?

1062
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,560
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Every game.

1063
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,430

1064
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,050
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

1065
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,470
Well, is that what we
have time for today?

1066
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,290
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually we do
have time for questions now.

1067
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:55,950
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh my gosh.

1068
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,460
We didn't even answer
our questions.

1069
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,060
TODD KERPELMAN: I know.

1070
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,150
All right.

1071
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,450
So we've got a few questions.

1072
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,220
And the first one is,
[INAUDIBLE]--

1073
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,350
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh my gosh.

1074
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,230
Look at all these questions.

1075
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,980
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
we do have

1076
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,850
quite a number of questions.

1077
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,390
COLT MCANLIS: Oh wow.

1078
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,830
TODD KERPELMAN: And, in fact,
maybe I should reload and make

1079
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,000
sure that--

1080
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,910
COLT MCANLIS: There's no
new question on top.

1081
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,230
TODD KERPELMAN: --there's
not a question.

1082
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,670
Because--

1083
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,850
11 questions.

1084
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,160
That's--

1085
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,570
WOLFF DOBSON: You actually
have to click that.

1086
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,420
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

1087
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,390
That's 10 more than I think
we had last time.

1088
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,190
WOLFF DOBSON: It's almost
like somebody knew

1089
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,200
we were doing this.

1090
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,560
TODD KERPELMAN: Can we talk
a little bit about cross

1091
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,200
platform convergence between
Chrome Web Store an Android

1092
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,720
via a unifying login experience
for players

1093
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,940
actually creating unified
app ID across platforms.

1094
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,520

1095
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,830
I don't know if there's
a whole lot we

1096
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,440
can really talk about.

1097
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,320
Let me see.

1098
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,700
I guess part of it really
depends on do we see, at some

1099
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,430
point, games in the browser,
games on your tablet.

1100
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,490
Are they going to be the same?

1101
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,300
I know this was sort of an issue
with a lot of the social

1102
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,110
game developers.

1103
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,880
Is they had these very popular
social games, tried to,

1104
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,130
essentially, take them as is on
to mobile devices and found

1105
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,690
that they just weren't
nearly as successful.

1106
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,210
And it was these companies that
basically created games

1107
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,500
from scratch on mobile devices
that were actually--

1108
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,570
very similar kind of Sim
building games that ended up

1109
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,370
being successful.

1110
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,970
Just because, even though the
games are similar, the play

1111
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,900
patterns and styles and the
amount of time you dedicate to

1112
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,750
playing a game on your phone,
versus playing a game on a

1113
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,080
tablet, versus playing a game
on a browser, is all just

1114
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,570
slightly different enough that
it's really hard to have the

1115
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,100
same game experience across
multiple devices.

1116
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,510
Even though--

1117
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,960
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and also,
there are lots of little tiny

1118
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,240
things when you're doing
development across platform.

1119
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,380
Like start-up time.

1120
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,760
A mobile game, given the
compressed time people are

1121
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,790
going to be playing it, they're
not going to be like,

1122
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm going to click this, go
read, read it, and then come

1123
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,650
back and it'll be loaded.

1124
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,360
So just doing the straight
ports that way

1125
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,140
sometimes can be--

1126
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,840
just doesn't work.

1127
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,190
Loading time, screen usage, real
estate, all that stuff.

1128
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,030
Yeah.

1129
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,610
TODD KERPELMAN: That
said, yeah.

1130
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,720
I think unifying login,
that would be nice.

1131
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,660
WOLFF DOBSON: That
would be cool.

1132
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,510
You should all use OAuth2.

1133
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,370
TODD KERPELMAN: That
would totally help.

1134
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,860
And did I hear that the
standard has been--

1135
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,570
WOLFF DOBSON: They're looking
for an RFC now.

1136
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:14,949
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

1137
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,290
COLT MCANLIS: Oh wow.

1138
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,929
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

1139
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:16,480
COLT MCANLIS: Very cool.

1140
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,940
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Cool.

1141
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,050
TODD KERPELMAN: That-- so what
that actually means is that

1142
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,849
it's going to be considered more
official than I guess it

1143
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:22,880
has been in the past.

1144
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,380
WOLFF DOBSON: The way it is
now, which is sort of

1145
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,670
official, it'll now be
sort of official.

1146
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,870
COLT MCANLIS: Well I thought the
word Auth in OAuth meant

1147
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,090
authoritative.

1148
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,719
Is that--

1149
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,400
is that not right?

1150
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,989
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

1151
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,170
Not exactly.

1152
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,655
It did in version 10, but
not inversion 16 or 21.

1153
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:39,030
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, you
got to update your--

1154
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,429
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

1155
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:39,869
Exactly.

1156
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,630
COLT MCANLIS: --client
side handling.

1157
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,150
TODD KERPELMAN: This
is a good question.

1158
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,050
I love the idea of
Native Client.

1159
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,880
WOLFF DOBSON: Native Client?

1160
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,600
What's that?

1161
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,139
TODD KERPELMAN: Have you
considered creating a special

1162
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,325
section in the Chrome Web Store
to just show apps that

1163
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:52,590
use Native Client to more
widely promote it's use?

1164
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,550
COLT MCANLIS: Interesting.

1165
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,790
First off, thank you
for the love.

1166
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,780
Native Client's fantastic
technology.

1167
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,670
We all love it here and embrace
it quite heartily.

1168
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,880
We haven't specifically called
out Native Client in the

1169
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,110
Chrome Web Store, simply because
we don't really feel

1170
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,520
that there's-- so Chrome Web
Store is a consumer driven

1171
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,130
place, right.

1172
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,590
And so most people coming to
Chrome Web Store are looking

1173
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,080
for a genre or a character
type or

1174
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,810
something along those lines.

1175
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,665
They're not really looking for--
hey, show me the best

1176
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,890
HTML 5 game.

1177
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,640
WOLFF DOBSON: We go into the
store looking for that.

1178
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,070
COLT MCANLIS: Right.

1179
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,510
Right.

1180
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,930
And, quite frankly, that
does occur but we

1181
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,000
are quite the minority.

1182
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,400
If you are looking for a great
collection of Native Client

1183
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,220
titles, though, you can actually
go to the Native

1184
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,930
Client website.

1185
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,310
We actually have a list of all
of them that we're aware of.

1186
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,180
Gonacl.com.

1187
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,930
That's G-O-N-A-C-L.com.

1188
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,350
And if you look on the sidebar
there's actually a little

1189
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,060
community section down there
that has a list of

1190
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,290
applications in the
Chrome Web Store.

1191
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,490
And they're great games.

1192
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,100
You should go check them out.

1193
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,390
And--

1194
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,650
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
doing right now.

1195
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,460
My goodness.

1196
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,250
There is one.

1197
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,020
COLT MCANLIS: Can we screen
cap from his machine?

1198
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,380
WOLFF DOBSON: I'll just kind of
turn around and pull it up.

1199
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,440
COLT MCANLIS: Definitely
check those out.

1200
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,420
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see.

1201
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,950
I'm actually going to skip
down to-- someone had a--

1202
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,360
speaking of cheating, can you
discuss the role of future

1203
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,850
cheat-proof games such that
every move is in the open and

1204
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:12,510
subject to review by everyone,
like Tic-Tac-Toe or chess.

1205
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,730
COLT MCANLIS: Wow.

1206
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,070
So I have an opinion on this.

1207
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,517
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

1208
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,130
COLT MCANLIS: Shockingly.

1209
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,790
WOLFF DOBSON: Not like normal.

1210
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,510
COLT MCANLIS: Not like normal.

1211
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:20,760
Right?

1212
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,640
Where I keep to myself.

1213
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,050
I not too sure about that.

1214
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,350
You're effectively crowd
sourcing games.

1215
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,190
This will only work for a
certain type of things, right?

1216
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,130
In addition to that, it's going
to slow down game play

1217
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,010
significantly.

1218
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,520
There was a big hubbub when the
NFL and the Major League

1219
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,110
Baseball added instant
replay review and

1220
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,520
those sorts of things.

1221
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,820
Everyone's big criticism is it's
going to slow the game

1222
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,780
down anymore.

1223
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:44,890
Right?

1224
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,180
And they added all these
other features.

1225
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,590
You can only do so many,
they cost you

1226
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,180
timeouts and other stuff.

1227
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,090
But still it's--

1228
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,030
in video games it's a little
bit different, right?

1229
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,940
It's a digital medium.

1230
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,060
There's millions of people
playing concurrent

1231
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,860
games all the time.

1232
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,990
Maybe if you had some way where
I play a move and then I

1233
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,250
check someone else's move?

1234
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,130
I don't know.

1235
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,920
It doesn't seem worth
the risk.

1236
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,380
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

1237
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,020
I--

1238
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And also, how
does that stop cheating?

1239
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,660
If I'm playing chess with
someone couldn't I have a

1240
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,330
chess simulation running
alongside?

1241
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,605
WOLFF DOBSON: It's a different
kind of cheating then what I

1242
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,850
think Alan is talking about
here, which is much more I

1243
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,180
make a move and then if
everybody accepts that was a

1244
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,940
true we can keep going.

1245
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,400
I think it's more, it would be
more implemented negatively,

1246
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,080
which is, that looks
like it's a lie.

1247
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,540
And--

1248
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,680
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
too good of a move.

1249
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,160
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, no, it's
more like in chess.

1250
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,960
Like, hey, your queen
just teleported.

1251
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,750
This-- if you ever Pirateer
the board game, it was

1252
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,900
actually in the rules
that cheating was

1253
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,850
part of this game.

1254
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Because
you're pirates.

1255
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,190
WOLFF DOBSON: Knocking the drink
over and then moving all

1256
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,440
the pieces around.

1257
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,740

1258
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,130
Yeah, and there's also the sense
of being able to roll

1259
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,590
back games and look
for cheats later.

1260
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,200
And verify that they're
actually true.

1261
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,130
So in real time you
leave it alone.

1262
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,930
But then when you post hoc, if
somebody challenges it, you

1263
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,950
can review them.

1264
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,440
And automated review and
things like that.

1265
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,160
It's a little bit like
the way the--

1266
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,830
when you go in and get
a document notarized.

1267
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,410
It doesn't make it any safer
to notarize it but it means

1268
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,040
that when you go backwards and
somebody challenges something

1269
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,900
the notarization says
this document was

1270
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,490
true at this time.

1271
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,330
So, yeah, definitely something
like that would be

1272
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,970
interesting.

1273
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,890
It's also a way people identify
cheaters or griefers.

1274
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,740
Just being able to say I enjoyed
playing with this

1275
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,820
person, I did not enjoy playing
with this person.

1276
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,600
And then if somebody gets
too many of these--

1277
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,130
that can be gamed pretty
heavily though.

1278
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,840
COLT MCANLIS: We're going to
be gamed the other way too.

1279
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,417
If you make a move and I have
to validate that was and

1280
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,400
actual move, and I don't like
your move because it's about

1281
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,100
to pwn me, I can grief you and
say, no it's not a good move.

1282
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,170
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
too good of a move.

1283
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:48,890
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

1284
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,240
You're too awesome
at this game--

1285
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,170
WOLFF DOBSON: Remind me not
to play chess with you.

1286
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,700
COLT MCANLIS: And I
no longer like it.

1287
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,480
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You just
check-mated me.

1288
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,060
That can't be legitimate.

1289
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,370
COLT MCANLIS: Possible.

1290
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,210
TODD KERPELMAN: I guess the
issue, for me, is there's a

1291
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,480
lot of games that are
interesting based on the fact

1292
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,805
that there is secret
information.

1293
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,760

1294
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,370
While Tic-Tac-Toe and chess and
checkers and those sorts

1295
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:15,510
of games there are no secrets,
you'd be cutting off a lot of

1296
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,090
interesting games in the
process, just by--

1297
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,670
WOLFF DOBSON: I think that's
one of the joys of computer

1298
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,820
media and gaming is assuming
that your database can handle

1299
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,730
that much writing.

1300
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,840
Being able to do all of your
moves on the server is great.

1301
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,360
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see.

1302
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,760
We've got two minutes left.

1303
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,740
Here's a short question.

1304
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,600
When will the NaCl VS plug-in
be available?

1305
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:37,920
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

1306
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,820
We are excited about this.

1307
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,400
We're starting to see the first
couple check-ins come

1308
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,460
through the tree.

1309
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,730
Exciting times are ahead.

1310
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,540
We're working out a couple bugs
right now, getting the

1311
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,830
documentation set up.

1312
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,320
We're expecting to
see it soon.

1313
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,560
The developer preview should
come out and the Pepper stable

1314
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,130
version, SDK, we're hoping
to land within

1315
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,810
another couple weeks.

1316
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,480
TODD KERPELMAN: VS here
being Visual Studio.

1317
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,970
COLT MCANLIS: Visual Studio.

1318
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,650
TODD KERPELMAN: Clarify for--
people wouldn't think it was

1319
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,680
versus or something.

1320
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,460
WOLFF DOBSON: I just want to
say that I went to the NaCl

1321
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,210
Gallery and I was horrified to
discover one of the games was

1322
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,920
called Wolf Toss.

1323
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,980
COLT MCANLIS: That's actually
a really good game.

1324
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,290
WOLFF DOBSON: I bet it
is but, I mean, dude.

1325
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:09,973
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
not about you.

1326
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,290
It's not always about you.

1327
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,420
WOLFF DOBSON: It is about me.

1328
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,440
COLT MCANLIS: I think we should
add a hack to it to put

1329
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,990
your face on the wolf.

1330
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,100
WOLFF DOBSON: Ahhh!

1331
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,050
COLT MCANLIS: We'll
email the authors.

1332
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,060
Guys over at [INAUDIBLE], if
you're watching, put his face

1333
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,620
on the wolf.

1334
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,330
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

1335
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Toss
that wolf.

1336
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,800

1337
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,330
TODD KERPELMAN: And let's see.

1338
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,880
We'll end on this
one question.

1339
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,650
Why are games getting easier
and easier year after year?

1340
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,920
Why are developers not
creating games

1341
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,170
like Baldur's Gate?

1342
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,560
Even Witcher was not as hard
as games some years ago.

1343
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,190
Do you remember Contra?

1344
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,180
WOLFF DOBSON: Contra.

1345
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They still
make Contra games.

1346
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:45,370
Contra 4 just came out
two years ago.

1347
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,130
Demon's Souls and Dark Souls--

1348
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,325
TODD KERPELMAN: I was going to
say, those were the games you

1349
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:49,560
were playing last time.

1350
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I
love those games

1351
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,560
because they're so difficult.

1352
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,020
So they're still out there,
but you they're not

1353
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,780
mainstream.

1354
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,110
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

1355
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,920
I was going to say, the main
answer to that is the

1356
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,770
expansion of the audience.

1357
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:08,070
When you get away from people
like me who sit alone in their

1358
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,500
basement playing video games and
trying to figure out how

1359
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,250
to build a--

1360
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,230
you're at a very technical and
very numerically savvy

1361
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,530
audience who is going to be min
maxing their heart out at

1362
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,040
things like Baldur's Gate.

1363
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,580
For when you want have
broad appeal games

1364
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,960
like Mass Effect where--

1365
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,150
in fact they had a neat, when
you play Mass Effect it

1366
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,630
actually gives you an option
in the beginning.

1367
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,510
Do you want to play this like
a first person shooter?

1368
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,040
Do you want to play this
only for the story?

1369
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,390
Or do you want to play
some balance of RPG?

1370
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,810
Because they're like, look,
there are all these different

1371
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,560
audiences who want to experience
this content.

1372
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,530
We're trying to mold it in a way
that makes it so that you

1373
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,195
can enjoy it no matter
what you're doing.

1374
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,960
COLT MCANLIS: Now, is the ending
different for each?

1375
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,190
I might have to send
some more emails.

1376
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,300
WOLFF DOBSON: You know what we
need to talk about is the

1377
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,700
ending to Mass Effect.

1378
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,000
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I can
really share the--

1379
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,650
who asked that question?

1380
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,530
I want to address
them by handle.

1381
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:57,770
TODD KERPELMAN: I
gotta look up.

1382
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,205
WOLFF DOBSON: You.

1383
00:41:58,205 --> 00:41:58,640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

1384
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,140
WOLFF DOBSON: You.

1385
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,680
You are just not playing
the right games.

1386
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,560
No.

1387
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,740
TODD KERPELMAN: T-O-M-A-S-Z.
Tomasz.

1388
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Tomasz.

1389
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,510
Tomas Z. I can share your
frustration because I love

1390
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,230
brutally difficult games.

1391
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,880
But they're still out there.

1392
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,400
A new Contra game is coming out
because I pay attention to

1393
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,010
Contra games, because I want
to just cry and slam the

1394
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,170
system down on the floor.

1395
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,810
WOLFF DOBSON: And this is why
they made wireless controllers

1396
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,912
so you can throw them.

1397
00:42:23,912 --> 00:42:25,310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

1398
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,150
WOLFF DOBSON: It doesn't
pull your entire--

1399
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,690
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And, I mean,
right now you could--

1400
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,730
I have collectively spend
about 250 hours playing

1401
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,170
Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.

1402
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,440
Go and check it out.

1403
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,570
WOLFF DOBSON: The other thing
is that, famously, Nintendo

1404
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,110
early on made their games
brutally hard because they

1405
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,820
weren't long enough.

1406
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,700
And that pipeline
was too short.

1407
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,870
The pipeline wasn't
full enough.

1408
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,780
They weren't going to be able to
release games fast enough.

1409
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,670
The manufacturing process for
cartridges was too difficult.

1410
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,630
And so having--

1411
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,170
making your games take longer
was just part of the thing.

1412
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,270
TODD KERPELMAN: Part
of the padding.

1413
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,470
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

1414
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,450
I went back and started playing
the original Colossal

1415
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:07,620
Cave Adventure game and
it was crazy hard.

1416
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,070
Even though I remembered
all the puzzles.

1417
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,750
I was sort of like, I
don't know how I--

1418
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,270
COLT MCANLIS: No, no.

1419
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,470
You want to cry?

1420
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,855
And we can close on this
if we need to.

1421
00:43:13,855 --> 00:43:14,110
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

1422
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,195
COLT MCANLIS: Go back and play
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1423
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:16,970
for the NES.

1424
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,400
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

1425
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,170
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Which one?

1426
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,370
COLT MCANLIS: The first one.

1427
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,330
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I've
beaten that.

1428
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:20,750
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

1429
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,860
Yeah, once.

1430
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I had
that game as a kid

1431
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,085
and I mastered it.

1432
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:26,790
WOLFF DOBSON: Next time we do
this we're going to bring this

1433
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:27,865
in and you're going
to play it.

1434
00:43:27,865 --> 00:43:28,120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'll play it.

1435
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,500
Oh, it's been years.

1436
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:28,910
COLT MCANLIS: I'll try it.

1437
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,640
I bought it on the Wii.

1438
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:29,900
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's brutal.

1439
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,580
COLT MCANLIS: It's brutal.

1440
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:30,940
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

1441
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,130
It hates you.

1442
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:32,810
COLT MCANLIS: Three weeks.

1443
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,440
I didn't turn the Wii off--

1444
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,000
WOLFF DOBSON: It absolutely
hates you.

1445
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,670
COLT MCANLIS: --because I
was used to doing that.

1446
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,570
Right.

1447
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,460
Couldn't do it.

1448
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That stage where
you're going through the

1449
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,040
water under the dam and you have
diffuse all the bombs and

1450
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,360
the clock is ticking.

1451
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,890
WOLFF DOBSON: It is--

1452
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,120
COLT MCANLIS: The worst thing
is that if you don't bring

1453
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,080
Donatello to the Mouser battle
you're just done.

1454
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,110
It's the whole level.

1455
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,730
All you're doing is trying to
get rid of Raphael because he

1456
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,430
doesn't matter to you.

1457
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,410
Just bring Donatello
to the Mouser.

1458
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,440
This is insane.

1459
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,130
Hardest game ever.

1460
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,190
WOLFF DOBSON: But the--

1461
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Another really
difficult game that's new is

1462
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,210
Super Meat Boy.

1463
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,630
That game is brutal.

1464
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,510
WOLFF DOBSON: Although
here's the thing with

1465
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,220
Super Meat Boy though.

1466
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,870
Super Meat Boy is incredibly
difficult.

1467
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,900
But Super Meat Boy
is also fair.

1468
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

1469
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,180
WOLFF DOBSON: In the sense that,
when you play it, you

1470
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,280
can get better at it.

1471
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
And your deaths are quick.

1472
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,990
And the reward for death is
that you get another cool

1473
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:13,560
little animation.

1474
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's often
what people praise Demon's

1475
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,240
Souls and Dark Souls for.

1476
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,930
Its brutal but it's fair.

1477
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,280
When you die you're not like,
oh this game cheated me.

1478
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,090
It's like no, I made
a mistake.

1479
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,520
WOLFF DOBSON: I shouldn't
have done that.

1480
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

1481
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,770
WOLFF DOBSON: That's why a lot
of people like playing NetHack

1482
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,440
without copying saves.

1483
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,820
Because they're good enough at
that game, if they die it was

1484
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,050
because they were clumsy.

1485
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,630
Its an execution thing.

1486
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,240
But going back to the idea that
the pipeline was so empty

1487
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,710
in the '90s, the pipeline is
really full now for games.

1488
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,185
So if your game is too hard
you're either going for core

1489
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,890
audience, and I think something
like Demon's Souls

1490
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,400
is a perfect example of
a core audience game.

1491
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,600
Who is looking for
that kind of--

1492
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,890
they're the same people who
throw themselves out of

1493
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:57,900
airplanes, right?

1494
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,092
I mean,--

1495
00:44:59,092 --> 00:44:59,490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

1496
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,360
WOLFF DOBSON: They're looking
for that challenge.

1497
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,680
You do wing suits and fly
down sides of mountains.

1498
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,170
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Squirrel
suits.

1499
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,120
WOLFF DOBSON: Just that
somebody's looking--

1500
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,530
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: While playing
Demon's Souls.

1501
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,070
WOLFF DOBSON: --for something
challenging.

1502
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,452
While in with a broad market and
a lot of people playing,

1503
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:17,980
and a lot of kids playing, you
just don't want to keep

1504
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,870
punching your audience
in the eye.

1505
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't know if
this made the last episode,

1506
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,880
but we were talking
about the stats of

1507
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,180
game completion rates.

1508
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,000
And it's very low, like 30% of
the audience makes it to the

1509
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,320
end of the game.

1510
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,220
So by, there's an incentive
there, I think, for game

1511
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,120
developers to make the game
easier and easier to be

1512
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,420
successful in and complete so
that people feel like they've

1513
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,440
got their money's worth and they
are also very proud of

1514
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,490
themselves because, hey,
I beat this game.

1515
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,816
Even though they've
made it so simple.

1516
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:46,660
WOLFF DOBSON: Too easy.

1517
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,415
TODD KERPELMAN: As someone that
has less time to play

1518
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:51,980
games, I appreciate the fact
that I can make it through a

1519
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,350
lot of the content without
having to replay the same

1520
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,490
level multiple times.

1521
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think--

1522
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,120
I forget which games on the Wii
did this, but they had a--

1523
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,420
I think there was a Mario game
for the Wii where if you died

1524
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,710
eight times they would actually
allow the computer to

1525
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,745
play the stage for you.

1526
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:07,420
WOLFF DOBSON: Show you how.

1527
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And then once
you made it past the part you

1528
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,000
couldn't make it passed before
you just press a button and

1529
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,550
you're back playing the game.

1530
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,280
WOLFF DOBSON: They also had a
really neat thing when you're

1531
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,300
playing with friends.

1532
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,770
If somebody dying all the time
they can just bubble up and

1533
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,890
just follow you.

1534
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh.

1535
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,170
OK.

1536
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,830
WOLFF DOBSON: So only one person
has to be good at the

1537
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,370
incredibly difficult
time jumps.

1538
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,370
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So more
mechanisms to make it easier.

1539
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,910
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, more
mechanisms to make it so

1540
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,680
people can stay together.

1541
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:28,990
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

1542
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,300
Yeah.

1543
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,440
WOLFF DOBSON: I think
that's cool.

1544
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,360
I'm with Todd.

1545
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,070
I like easy games.

1546
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,890
TODD KERPELMAN: I didn't
say I like easy.

1547
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,884
I just like being able to make
it through without having to--

1548
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:37,356
WOLFF DOBSON: I like
being challenged.

1549
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:38,500
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

1550
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,580
WOLFF DOBSON: I like
doing nothing.

1551
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,700
COLT MCANLIS: I like games
I have to program

1552
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,470
algorithms to beat.

1553
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:42,850
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

1554
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,800
Well, we are, I think, a
little over time now.

1555
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,750
So we're going to wrap up.

1556
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,330
But we'll be back in a couple
weeks and we'll hopefully come

1557
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,400
up with some other interesting
questions.

1558
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Now tell your
friends about this show.

1559
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,786
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

1560
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:54,500
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

1561
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,360
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

1562
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,320
I actually, I really like the
fact that we had a lot more

1563
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,100
questions this time.

1564
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,600
So tell your friends.

1565
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,310
Have them all ask any sorts
of gaming question.

1566
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,350
WOLFF DOBSON: Keep sending in
those cards and letters.

1567
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,460
TODD KERPELMAN: Fewer
Android questions.

1568
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,780
Were generally not
the Android guys.

1569
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,500
They have their own show.

1570
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,280
We don't talk to them.

1571
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,270
WOLFF DOBSON: You can ask
us Android questions.

1572
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: If there are
certain games you want us to

1573
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,655
review or talk about feel free
to throw up some questions.

1574
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:13,950
WOLFF DOBSON: Sure.

1575
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:16,060
And if you have games that you
think we should be playing,

1576
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,640
either because they're
too hard or they're

1577
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,705
too easy, you should--

1578
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:19,300
COLT MCANLIS: Then
send them to us.

1579
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:19,720
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

1580
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,290
Send them to us.

1581
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:20,840
We'd love to see them.

1582
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,350
COLT MCANLIS: For free.

1583
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:22,400
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

1584
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,650
We got to go.

1585
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:52,700
