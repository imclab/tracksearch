00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,140
-We wouldn't be where we are
at Google without you, the

4
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,390
developer community.

5
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,430
Since 2005, we've made dozens
of APIs and tools

6
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,530
available to you.

7
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,280
Then you went out and
built marvels.

8
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,080
Now with so many creations, we
think there's a better way for

9
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,320
them to work together, because
there are a lot.

10
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,820
So we did some spring cleaning,
then asked you how

11
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,190
we could do it better.

12
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,500
We used your ideas to begin
building a single place for

13
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,300
all of the developer resources,

14
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,170
tools, events, and community.

15
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,610
And all that together
looks like this.

16
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,240

17
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,630
Developers.google.com.

18
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,380
But it's more than
just a logo.

19
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,430
It's a symbol for all the
amazing work you do in the

20
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,800
world and how you
work together.

21
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,460
Soon you can find tools, get
ideas, and connect with others

22
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,780
all in one place, then
get down to business.

23
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,790
Collaboration and coding power
that creates magical solutions

24
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,020
with a universal language, so
you can take that mass of code

25
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,360
and blow minds.

26
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
For reals.

27
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,590
So kick off your shoes and
explore all the ways you can

28
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,980
connect, because it's not just
about code, it's about you.

29
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,800
Then start building, because
together, there's no telling

30
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,290
what we'll create next.

33
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,550
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

34
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,610
And thank you for coming to
our Lightning Talks today.

35
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,680
I just have a couple things
to say as we get started.

36
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,300
We have this agenda for you.

37
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,040
So we're going to start out with
Android, go through the

38
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,410
whole gamut, and
end up at Maps.

39
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,140
And one thing I wanted to
mention before we got started

40
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,050
is that there is a whole
bunch of Google

41
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,240
stuff going on today.

42
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,540
So we've got the Lightning Talks
today, but we have all

43
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,730
these other houses going with
Maps, and Developers, and

44
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,050
Android, and I really recommend
you check out all of

45
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,760
these things.

46
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,640
And if you forget this map, a
lot of us are wearing these

47
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,120
sweatshirts.

48
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,540
And it won't be creepy, just
go up and look at where you

49
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,340
need to go.

50
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,280
There's also this URL that'll
give you the maps and all the

51
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,130
other talks that are going on
by Googlers or at the Google

52
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,910
Developer Houses.

53
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,670
Thank you so much.

54
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,510
And I'd like to welcome up
Trevor, who's going to begin

55
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,550
by talking about Android,
Android apps should look like,

56
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,800
and where you can go
to build them.

57
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,695

58
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:09,780
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

59
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,580
Hi, everyone.

60
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,000
My name is Trevor Johns, and
I'm a Developer Programs

61
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,010
Engineer with the Android
Team at Google.

62
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,370
And today, I'm going to be
talking about Android user

63
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,640
interface design, and
specifically what we've done

64
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,470
with the last few releases of
Android with the Holo UI.

65
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,800
So we're going to start out,
give you a brief tour of where

66
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,810
we've gone in the past, how
Android's evolved, the changes

67
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,060
we've made, why we've made them,
and what they mean to

68
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,410
you as an Android
app developer.

69
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,670
So let's go ahead and step in
our time machine here, and

70
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,030
we're going to roll all
the way back to

71
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,630
Android 1.5, Cupcake.

72
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,490
So for those of you who are
keeping score, this was

73
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,120
released roughly in the era of
the G1, one of our first

74
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,390
releases, back in 2009.

75
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,890
Technically it wasn't our
first release, that was

76
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,690
Android 1.0, but it looked
pretty much the same.

77
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,710
And if you're using Android
today, it should be familiar,

78
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,430
you have your App Launcher, you
have your Icon Drawer, and

79
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,270
we opened up a Settings App
here just as a demo.

80
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,110
And you can see that there's
this little drawer you had to

81
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,280
pull up manually, we have this
big, bulky search widget on

82
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,950
the desktop.

83
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,730
The Settings App, you sort of
get this sort of ugly wall of

84
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,900
text with these down chevrons
that go somewhere down, I'm

85
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,190
not sure where Down means.

86
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,420
And that was Android.

87
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,050
Sort of a rough start,
but we'll get there.

88
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,580
So let's move forward
one version.

89
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,900
This is Donut now, released just
a short time later, and

90
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,410
not much has actually changed.

91
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,750
We've gone and cleaned up that
big, bulky search widget, it's

92
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,260
a little more streamlined now,
but not too many other changes

93
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,940
there that are really notable,
at least as far

94
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,770
as the UI is concerned.

95
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,310
So then we're going to take
one more step forward to

96
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,270
Android 2.0, that's Eclair.

97
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,630
And this release is notable
because this is the one that

98
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,970
came out with the
Motorola Droid.

99
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,020
We did a lot of work to go and
clean up the UI here, so icons

100
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,470
are a little bit more
streamlined, the Settings App

101
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,180
is actually not a giant wall of
text, we've gotten rid of

102
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,210
those confusing chevrons.

103
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,930
The App Launcher is still more
or less the same thing,

104
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,660
though, you have the store you
pull up manually, some carbon

105
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,549
fiber texter there in the
background, and that was what

106
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:14,040
we released there
with the Droid.

107
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,200
Take one more step forward
here, and get to Froyo,

108
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,750
Version 2.2.

109
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,430
And this one is probably where
you see the most changes.

110
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,640
We've actually gone and removed
the drawer that you

111
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,170
actually had to go and swipe
up with an App Launcher

112
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,598
button, added a set of Quick
Actions there at the bottom to

113
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,610
go and pull up the phone and the
browser, which are pretty

114
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,920
common actions on a smartphone,
and we added

115
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,130
System-wide Search, so you'll
notice that Search widget's

116
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,190
changed just a little
bit, too.

117
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,520
Settings App still looks
more or less the same.

118
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,460
You still have this gray bar at
the top with this App Name,

119
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,340
navigation hasn't
changed much.

120
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,285
And that was probably, to date,
the biggest change to

121
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:56,000
the Android UI we've seen.

122
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,420
And then one last step forward,
which was Android

123
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,760
2.3, Gingerbread.

124
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,465
And you'll notice the biggest
change here is we sort of made

125
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:05,630
the UI a little bit darker, this
little widget we added on

126
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,030
the desktop to sort of give
you a tutorial has changed

127
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,140
just slightly, made it a little
darker, the Quick

128
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,710
Actions at the bottom have
changed, the Notification Bar

129
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,440
has changed.

130
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,760
Still the same Settings App,
still the same Launcher,

131
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,060
pretty much.

132
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,900
And so that was our previous
releases of Android.

133
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,350
That's where we've come to
up until fairly recently.

134
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,140
So when we were building
Honeycomb, we took a step back

135
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,120
and said, well, we've had the
same look since the beginning.

136
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,470
What can we change?

137
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,910
There's a lot of wasted screen
real estate with buttons, a

138
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,370
lot of space taken up by these
big, bulky text fields, and it

139
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,420
sort of felt inspired
by a desktop OS.

140
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,460
And you have this magical pane
of glass in front of you, and

141
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
there's so much more
you can do.

142
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,310
It can be this tactile
experience.

143
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,820
You can go and get rid of all
these desktop metaphors and

144
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,780
sort of come up with a
brand new experience.

145
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,570
And, like I said, we haven't
really changed that much.

146
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,980
There was that change with 1.5,
but it was more of an

147
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,020
incremental change, it wasn't
really revolutionary.

148
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,760
We also noticed that there's
a lot of inconsistency.

149
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,690
Android, of course, allows
device manufacturers to go and

150
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,920
modify the OS, to go and
edit and to add some

151
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,370
distinctiveness to it.

152
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,450
But the feedback we heard from
a lot of designers was if you

153
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,960
go and change the text color,
if you change the selection

154
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,900
color, if you change the way a
List View behaves, the way

155
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,670
Overscroller works, and you're
really going for that picture

156
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,490
perfect UI, when these things
change out from under you, it

157
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,810
makes it hard to go and make
your app look beautiful.

158
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,350
So we took all this feedback,
and we put it together and we

159
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,500
got to what we call Holo,
our holographic UI.

160
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,280
So going back to 2.3 here,
let's take one more step

161
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,910
forward, and this is the
face of Android today.

162
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,630
Still the same metaphors you're
sort of familiar with

163
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,530
as far as having an App
Launcher, right?

164
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,210
I mean, there hasn't been that
much that's changed there.

165
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,370
But the bigger changes are
a little more subtle.

166
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,330
If you look at the Search
Widget, you'll notice it's a

167
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,110
lot more minimalist. We've added
these blue futuristic

168
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,240
highlights everywhere, organized
the Settings App

169
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,730
finally so it actually makes
a little bit more sense to

170
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,890
scroll through.

171
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,910
And then there's also this space
at the top of the screen

172
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,460
that's reserved for what
we call the action bar.

173
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,090
And we'll go into that in a bit
more detail, but that's

174
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,510
actually pretty important.

175
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,840
So this is Holo.

176
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,410
One release for all devices,
whether or not it's a tablet

177
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,910
or a phone.

178
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,180
And we really have gone through
and we've taken a look

179
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,350
at everything in the phone,
whether or not it's how a

180
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,780
dialog appears, how a List View
behaves, how you scroll

181
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,080
through your media, and asked
ourselves what assumptions

182
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,520
we've been making
for this design.

183
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,020
And this goes all the way down
to the Widget Toolkit.

184
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,610
So this is the selection of most
of the controls that come

185
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,190
with the SDK, of course,
you can add more.

186
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,090
The big one there is probably
the Text Input Fields, and you

187
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,150
can actually barely see
them on the screen.

188
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,510
It's sort of up there in the
upper right, and it's actually

189
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,890
just a line.

190
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,600
And I'll show you a screen shot
of that in a moment, but

191
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,156
actually, let's go right
there right now.

192
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:04,690
So on the left is the Email App
in Gingerbread, and on the

193
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,465
right is the Email
App in Honeycomb

194
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,970
and Ice Cream Sandwich.

195
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,470
And you'll notice, we've really
just reduced it to a

196
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,630
sheet of paper.

197
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,180
Of course, you still need your
Text Fields to address the

198
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,930
email, give it a subject,
actually compose.

199
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,910
But the UI sort of fades into
the background and brings your

200
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,810
content front and center so the
users can focus on their

201
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,450
creativity and not on what
their phone is trying to

202
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,230
impose as far as the
UI's concerned.

203
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,150
So we basically have three
design principles that

204
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,360
underlie Holo.

205
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,740
And we wanted a UI that felt
enchanting, that simplified

206
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,610
users' lives, and that made
them feel amazing and

207
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,520
empowered because of that.

208
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,270
So let's talk about those in a
little bit more detail, give

209
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,060
you a quick tour through
the some of the

210
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,330
design highlights here.

211
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,650
So we wanted to be delightful.

212
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,840
There's lots of visual
flourishes sprinkled

213
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,070
throughout the OS.

214
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,895
When you're scrolling left or
right on the Home Screen and

215
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:02,830
you hit one end of the screen,
this pane of light will sort

216
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,030
of pop out from the screen
for just a second.

217
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,700
It's a very subtle effect, but
it gives your phone a bit of

218
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,280
personality, makes it feel a bit
more fun, makes you feel

219
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
like it has a bit more
substance, that you're

220
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,040
actually working with this
physical interface

221
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,320
inside of the phone.

222
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,350
Sort of extending from that idea
of a physical interface,

223
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,640
objects behave as actual objects
rather than buttons.

224
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,750
If you have an icon and you
drop it on top of another

225
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,380
icon, what do you expect
should happen?

226
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,330
They should stack.

227
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,260
Well, that's exactly
what happens.

228
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,770
And so little things like
that are found all

229
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,070
throughout the OS.

230
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,040
Personalization has always
been an important part of

231
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Android, it still is.

232
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,240
We want the user to feel like
their phone belongs to them,

233
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,550
so of course, it starts with
things like setting your

234
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,440
background, being able to go
and adjust the behavior of

235
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,340
your phone, add widgets
everywhere,

236
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,400
make the phone yours.

237
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,490
On the other hand, the phone
will get to know you and

238
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,160
personalize itself
automatically.

239
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,800
So as you're browsing around
the web, and say you go and

240
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,200
visit Wikipedia a lot.

241
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,700
Your phone will, of course,
save that in its local

242
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,280
history, and then later on, when
you go and try and do a

243
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,260
system-wide search, it'll check
that history and start

244
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,510
adding auto-complete suggestions
for Wikipedia,

245
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,760
even though you're not
in the browser.

246
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,740

247
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,260
So the next topic there,
simplifying your life.

248
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,240

249
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,550
Actually, let's move to
the next screen here.

250
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,920
So first things first, we want
to go and keep the dialogues

251
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,820
nice and simple, wizards
nice and simple.

252
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,780
When you first turn your
phone on, we have this

253
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,860
initial setup process.

254
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,542
So as an example here, one of
the screens asks you to go and

255
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:38,010
set up a Google account.

256
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,580
And we keep the text there
brief, and when you actually

257
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,930
go to sign up for the account,
it's just a one-page

258
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,220
form you fill out.

259
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,670
Just as an example there, but
throughout the system, we've

260
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,490
gone and reevaluated all of our
dialogs, trying to figure

261
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,340
out where we were being too
verbose, not saying enough,

262
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,590
and kept it basically the bare
minimum we could while still

263
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,200
being informative.

264
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,740
Pictures and these graphical
UIs are a big part of Holo.

265
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,150
We sort of call this like a
Magazine UI, so big, high

266
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,025
resolution, vibrant pictures
right there in

267
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:09,180
front of your screen.

268
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,930
And so this is the Dialer App.

269
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,990
When you launched Dialer App in
the past, it used to give

270
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,310
you this whole list view of
contacts, and you could scroll

271
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,800
through, and eventually,
you'd find who

272
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,730
you're looking through.

273
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,790
You could star people, add
them to the Quick List.

274
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,700
We found that it makes it a lot
quicker if you just have a

275
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,420
picture right there.

276
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,116
If I want to call Mattias and I
open my phone, well there he

277
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,592
is in the upper left hand
corner where I can

278
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:27,725
just click on him.

279
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,810
I don't actually have to go
through and read everything.

280
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,760
And so pictures are a lot
faster than words.

281
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,340
We try and use these high
resolution images throughout

282
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,530
the UI whenever we can.

283
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,870
We also try and do the right
thing automatically.

284
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,080
So we've added a feature in
Android Four, Ice Cream

285
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,090
Sandwich, called Android Beam.

286
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,010
And when you take two phones and
you hold them next to each

287
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,470
other, if they have an NFT
antenna, they'll detect that

288
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,840
the other phone is
in proximity and

289
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,700
enter the Share Mode.

290
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,010
You can then go and tap on
whatever content is on your

291
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,150
screen, and it'll send it
over to the other phone.

292
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,620
So we're using this contact
sensitivity to go and just

293
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,380
automatically throw the user
into the Share Mode so that

294
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,770
the action they most likely want
to perform, since they've

295
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,000
put their phones next
to another phone, is

296
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,110
just one tap away.

297
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,340
Of course, you still want to
leave that final act up to the

298
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,120
user and not do everything for
them, but just get them into

299
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,860
the right position so that
they're ready to do that.

300
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,620
Navigation is, of course,
important.

301
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,040
We've always had this concept
of a Back button on Android.

302
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,520
We've got and extended that a
bit more with the Action Bar.

303
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,480
I'll go into that in a bit more
detail in a moment here.

304
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,820
Also, we've gone and taken the
most commonly used actions and

305
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,850
pulled them out of
the Menu Bar.

306
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,620
In fact, the Menu Bar is
pretty much [INAUDIBLE]

307
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,290
at this point.

308
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,610
If you target your app for
Android Three or above, so

309
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,040
anyone running Holo, we actually
remove the Menu

310
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,250
button from the screen and
place all of the old Menu

311
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,080
commands up in this
Action Bar.

312
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,850
And as a developer, you could
pick whether or not something

313
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,090
should be displayed right there,
one click away, at the

314
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,360
top of the Action Bar, or we
still do have an Overflow Menu

315
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,820
where you can hide the less
commonly used actions.

316
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,250
But the really important actions
should be right there,

317
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,930
one click away at all times, and
your phone should go and

318
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,660
adjust its UI to what
you're doing so

319
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,270
those are always there.

320
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,890
And I'll give you some more
examples of that in a moment.

321
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,690

322
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,120
Also going off of navigation,
consistency is important.

323
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,470
The Action Bar that we've added
does a lot towards that.

324
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,030
So we have examples here
from Maps, Inbox,

325
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,430
and the Gallery App.

326
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,870
And you'll notice that even
though they are very different

327
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,580
apps, they look different.

328
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,460
A Map View looks a lot different
than a Gallery View

329
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,620
looks a lot different
than your email.

330
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,940
The navigation looks the same
in all of those, and that's

331
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,730
intentional.

332
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,400
And we've provided the tools
to go and do that for app

333
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,210
developers anywhere
in the system.

334
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,020
And if you're a long-time
Android user, notifications

335
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,220
are of course a very important
part of that experience, we've

336
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,080
had that since the beginning.

337
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,280
But just to go and reiterate,
we want to go and make sure

338
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,410
that whenever there's an
important event that occurs,

339
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,160
of course, since it's important,
you want to let the

340
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,390
user know, but make sure that
you only interrupt them if

341
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,490
it's important.

342
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,190
And if it's not important, we
go and tuck it away so that

343
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,430
users can respond to that
notification later.

344
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,030
So we bring things up, give them
a chance to respond, and

345
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,230
then let them deal with things
on their own time, so you

346
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,970
don't get any big, bulky dialogs
that come up and stop

347
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,620
the user from what they're
trying to do.

348
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,750
So on this last part about
empowering the user and making

349
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,030
them feel amazing, we've added
lots of gestures throughout

350
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,290
the system that let
you go and--

351
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,510
basically, they're tricks that
let the user pull something

352
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,410
off with some gesture, some
action, and do it without

353
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,090
having to push a button.

354
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,160
We're trying to remove as many
buttons from the UI as we can.

355
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,390
And gestures are always a little
tricky because you can

356
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,060
put up a little tool tip and
tell them, but most of the

357
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,440
time, they're not pushing
something

358
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,570
that's labeled there.

359
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,660
So once you go and perform some
gesture, we want to make

360
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,850
sure that it works throughout
the system.

361
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,990
Once you've learned in Gmail
that you can swipe left and

362
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,290
right between your email
messages, you'll discover oh,

363
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,850
you can do the same thing in
Google Play, you can swipe

364
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,250
left to right between categories
in the App Store.

365
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,020
You can also go into the Google
Plus App and do the

366
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,390
same thing and switch
between your own

367
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,540
circles and people nearby.

368
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,260
Dialogs, we've gone and cleaned
those up again, made

369
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,730
sure that they're
actually useful.

370
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,580
Rather than just saying that
there's an error that's

371
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,760
occurred and taking you onto the
Support Page, we try and

372
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,790
give you the text you need to
make sure you can respond to

373
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:26,160
it and actually resolve
the situation.

374
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,100
There's little bits of visual
encouragement sprinkled

375
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,740
throughout the system.

376
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,390
So as you're going and dragging
icons around, we

377
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,650
overlay this grid and put this
little shadow of the icon that

378
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,170
sort of jumps around as you
drag your icons around.

379
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,470
So even if you've never used
an Android device before,

380
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,110
you'll immediately know that
these devices are going to go

381
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,360
and snap to a grid.

382
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,530

383
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,630
And finally, this is less of
a UI issue and more of a

384
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,260
functionality issue, but apps
should be smart, and they

385
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,820
should do the heavy lifting
for the user.

386
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,340
If you have a smartphone in
your pocket, it should be

387
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,280
smart, right?

388
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,000
So it's little things.

389
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,560
If you're in the Camera App,
you should automatically

390
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,750
adjust white balance,
you should

391
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,420
automatically set focal points.

392
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,440
Sure, give the users a way to
go and set it if they want,

393
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,060
but by default, you should
just go and do everything

394
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,430
automatically.

395
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,110
Which also gets to the next
point here, which is you

396
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,050
should make the important things
fast. Again, if you're

397
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,270
in the Camera App, the
most important

398
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,640
thing is taking a picture.

399
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,780
If you press that Shutter
button, you should take a

400
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,090
picture immediately.

401
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,920
So we've even gone so far as
to go and add zero-second

402
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,840
shutter lags.

403
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,940
From the moment you press that
button, the photo is

404
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,080
immediately saved to disk and
there's no delay while you're

405
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,070
waiting for the shutter to fire
and for it to find the

406
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,250
focal point.

407
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,150
It's instant.

408
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,150
So as an Android app developer,
what does all of

409
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,970
this mean to you?

410
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,450
So we've gone and put together
a collection of design

411
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,390
patterns that you can use.

412
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,280
And the most important one, if
you haven't heard me mention

413
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,720
it a dozen times already,
is the Action bar.

414
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,970
This is the roughly 50 pixels,
I can't remember the exact

415
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,480
number, of space at the top of
your screen that's reserved

416
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,280
for the most important
navigational elements.

417
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,190
And it's broken up into
three sections.

418
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,010
You have an App icon, which
tells you where you are.

419
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,880
Typically, this is going to be
your own application's icon,

420
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,890
but you can change it, if you're
in a document, make it

421
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,990
look like you're docked,
things like that.

422
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,810
You have View Details, this is
things like navigational tabs.

423
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,900
And then you have your Action
buttons, which tell the user

424
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,160
what they can do.

425
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,110
And this can either be the
Overflow menu, where you put

426
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,400
the less commonly used actions,
like I said, you can

427
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
bring those actions front and
center, just place them there.

428
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,510
You can even add custom views,
things like search widgets.

429
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,900
Basically, anything the user
wants to do commonly should be

430
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,910
part of that Action Bar.

431
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,580
It's also contextual.

432
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,510
So as you start making
selections, we actually will

433
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,310
swap that Action bar out, flip
it around, and give you a

434
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,770
completely different
set of commands.

435
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,420
If you're in email, normally the
first thing you'd want to

436
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,380
do is compose a new message.

437
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,390
Once you start selecting
messages, it's not likely

438
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,900
that's what you want
to do anymore.

439
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,710
Most likely what you want to
do is something related to

440
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,390
organization.

441
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,950
You're going to want to archive
your messages, or

442
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,510
you're going to want to go and
maybe mass delete them if

443
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,510
they're all spam,
Heaven forbid.

444
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,750
So as soon as you go and enter
this different mode, the phone

445
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,760
will go and adapt and place you
in the right context for

446
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,520
whatever it is that you're
most likely to

447
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,240
going to want to do.

448
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,880
Navigation.

449
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,450
I mentioned that there is this
Back button, and then we've

450
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,850
added an initial Back command
up to the Action bar.

451
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,160
So the Back button, which
has been there since the

452
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,100
beginning, provides temporal
back navigation.

453
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,860
So if I'm in my web browser and
I click a link that takes

454
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,500
me to the Google Play Store,
when I click Back, it's going

455
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,740
to take me back into the
browser, because that's the

456
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,370
last thing I did as far
as my sequence of

457
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,690
events on the phone.

458
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,550
But what we discovered is
sometimes users actually want

459
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,330
to go and once they navigate
into that other app, they want

460
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,140
to go and explore more there.

461
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,700
They want to get back to the
home page of that app.

462
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,990
And so the other Back button is
a hierarchical Back button.

463
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,680
It'll take you back up within
the navigational tree of the

464
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,110
current application.

465
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,720
So we actually call it Up.

466
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,590
So that's actually, if you think
of a tree, you're going

467
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,200
back up to the root
of that tree.

468
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,660
So if I'm in Google Play and I'm
in an App Detail page and

469
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,810
I click Up, it'll start taking
me back to the Google Play

470
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,690
main screen.

471
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,610
And so that's a really important
navigational pattern

472
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,040
that you'll find all throughout
Android now, and

473
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,890
it's really important to go and
make sure your apps are

474
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,420
updated to go [INAUDIBLE]

475
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,010
of that.

476
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,570
Multiple pane layouts are
important, because again, we

477
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,930
have one release of Android
for tablets and phones.

478
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,060
So this is sort of a pattern
people have been using in

479
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,090
mobile apps since
the beginning.

480
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,470
You have, say, your
Contacts App.

481
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,030
You have this table of contents
that lists all of

482
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,640
your contacts, you click on
somebody, and it'll take you

483
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,030
into a Detail View.

484
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,800
So what we've done is we've
broken that up into what we

485
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,500
call fragments, so you can go
and lay them out side by side.

486
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,230
So now, same views, you still
have that table of

487
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,040
contents on the left.

488
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,020
You still have your details on
the right, but you can go and

489
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,370
stack them and rearrange them.

490
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,940
And so this does two things.

491
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,200
One, it's a really intuitive way
to go into the device as a

492
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,930
user, and as an app developer,
it allows you

493
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,830
to reuse your code.

494
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,070
It's actually the exact same
code laying out that table of

495
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,690
contents and displaying that
Detail View, we're just going

496
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,965
in and rendering both of
them simultaneously.

497
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:08,510

498
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,160
And there's a lot of options
are to go in and rearrange

499
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,640
things, too.

500
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,170
So you can go and of course,
place them side by side like I

501
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,520
did in that example, or you can
go and stack them on the

502
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,030
right, stack on the bottom, have
things slide in and out.

503
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,370
We've added commands to
go and do animation.

504
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,210
So there's lot of different ways
to go and compose your UI

505
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,350
and make something that looks
really beautiful.

506
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,820
And as an app designer,
it's up to you to

507
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,910
figure out what works.

508
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,070
We've given you the tools to
make sure that you can do it.

509
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,240

510
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,050
I mentioned gestures already.

511
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,190
Gestures are really important.

512
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,830
We want to make sure that your
device feels like an actual

513
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,740
environment that users
are interacting with.

514
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,860
So we've actually documented a
whole set of common gestures,

515
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,360
things that app developers will
want to go and integrate

516
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,960
into their app, things like
double tapping to go and zoom

517
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,550
in, being able to go and swipe
left and right to go and move

518
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,410
between pages.

519
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,930
Actually, that's what my
next slide will talk a

520
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,390
little bit more, too.

521
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,060
Drag and drop, we've added a
lot more APIs to go and let

522
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,290
you go and take care of drag and
drop and move data between

523
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,300
different fragments.

524
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,989
Swipe Views.

525
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,340
Like I said, you want to make
sure you can go and page

526
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,840
through the different
parts of your app.

527
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,380
We've added a class to our API
called View Pager that makes

528
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,420
this really easy.

529
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,389
And one last thing to talk about
here is, make sure your

530
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,270
app feels like a pure
Android App.

531
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,650
So I've taken a collection
here of UI elements from

532
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,320
different mobile OS's.

533
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,949
And functionally, they're
all the same.

534
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,692
A button is a button, a check
box is a check box, a text

535
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:37,340
field is a text field.

536
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,429
But visually, they look
completely different.

537
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,900
And if you're porting your app
over from one environment to

538
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,080
another and you use the visual
elements from that other

539
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,850
environment, not only is it
going to make your app just

540
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,820
look wrong, it's going to
confuse users too, because on

541
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,570
other environments, they
actually do have subtle

542
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,030
differences in behavior.

543
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,020
And this is not just about
making sure your buttons look

544
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,900
the same, but the way things
behave and the way

545
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,430
things are laid out.

546
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,520
So to give you a few examples
here, we have the Dialer App.

547
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,660
And when you're in the Dialer
App on the Android, you'll

548
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,620
notice that there is, again,
that Action Bar at the top

549
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,780
that contains your navigation.

550
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,970
On the right here, we have the
Dialer App from IOS, and that

551
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,730
Tab Bar is at the bottom.

552
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,410
And you never have a Tab Bar
at the bottom on an Android

553
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,025
app, but yet, we see
app developers go

554
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:23,782
and make that mistake.

555
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:28,010
To give you a couple other
examples here, Back Commands

556
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,130
that are actually labeled you'll
never do, it's always

557
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,910
that Up Command.

558
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,890
And when you're in a List View,
you should never have

559
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,950
right-facing chevrons.

560
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,250
When you're in a List View,
it should be obvious

561
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,350
you're in a List View.

562
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,670
Remember that screen shot I
showed of Android 1.5 where we

563
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,790
had all those really
confusing chevrons.

564
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,010
Of course, those pointed down
and I have no clue where down

565
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,200
goes, but is that really any
different than right?

566
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,820
When you click on something in
Android, it doesn't side of

567
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,280
the way, it just jumps into
that next screen.

568
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,710
So a right-facing chevron
doesn't make any more sense.

569
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,030
So we've taken all of these tips
and even more, and we've

570
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,700
put them on a site that we call
Android Design, and we

571
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,590
just launched it a
few weeks ago.

572
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,730
And we've put together a lot
of resources for you as app

573
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,270
designers, weather it's UI
essentials for Photoshop, all

574
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,690
of the design philosophy and
design patterns that I've

575
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,050
mentioned, put them up there for
you as well, basically so

576
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,520
that you can figure out
everything that we were

577
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,710
thinking when we were developing
the OS, that you

578
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,340
can apply those to your app.

579
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,510
So if there's one thing that
you take out of this talk

580
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,960
today, it's this URL here,
developer.android.com/design.

581
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,300
Go there, read through it all,
internalize it, and do what we

582
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,310
did with Honeycomb and
Ice Cream Sandwich.

583
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,580
Take a step back.

584
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,280
Ask yourself, is there some
assumption I've been making as

585
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,690
an app developer as to how users
are using my app, and is

586
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,810
there some way I can simplify it
and make it feel more like

587
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,120
an Android app, make it feel
more at home, and in doing so,

588
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,410
make it a bit more beautiful?

589
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,700
All right.

590
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,695
Thank you.

591
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:59,810
[APPLAUSE]

592
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you, Trevor.

593
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,200
So while Trevor's taking down
his laptop and we're getting

594
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,350
Jonathan Beri set up here, we do
have a moment or two for a

595
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,370
few questions.

596
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,960
Does anybody have questions
for Trevor

597
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,210
about the Android universe?

598
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,180

599
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,820
Yes.

600
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,007
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
taking questions

601
00:37:18,007 --> 00:37:19,990
not related to design?

602
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,300
TREVOR JOHNS: Sure.

603
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,230
Maybe, yeah.

604
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,720
Depends on your question.

605
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,960
MALE SPEAKER: So is there a way
right now, there's these

606
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,490
apps called Mr. Phone, for
example, that intercept the

607
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,990
incoming call to check if the
phone number is from a

608
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,690
spammer, and that functionality
doesn't work on

609
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,790
my Sprint Android phone, mainly
because Sprint is by

610
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,260
far the worst of the telecom
services, maybe.

611
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,840
But is that an Android feature
or a Sprint feature to turn

612
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,350
off that ability?

613
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,890
TREVOR JOHNS: So we have what
we call the Android

614
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,720
Compatibility Definition
Document and Compatibility

615
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,850
Test Suite.

616
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,130
And this is the set of standards
that tell device

617
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,920
manufacturers what an Android
device should behave like.

618
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,550
So this covers things
like API calls.

619
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,300
So if there's some API call
that's supposed to tell you

620
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,040
what number is calling and
that's not working, that means

621
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,730
that most likely, the device
manufacturer made a change to

622
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,930
the phone that for some
reason was not

623
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,400
covered by our test suite.

624
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,560
And I can tell you right now
that API call should be

625
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,030
mentioned in our CDD, our
compatibility definition.

626
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,630
So I'd want to actually take
a look at that app and see

627
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,530
exactly what it's doing
and why our test

628
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,000
didn't catch that.

629
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,855
So if you talk to me after the
talk, I can take a look at it

630
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,190
and try and get some more
information and figure out

631
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,290
what exactly is going
on there.

632
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,130
Android devices should always
behave the same no matter who

633
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,480
manufactured them.

634
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,290
Even if they've gone and
modified the UI, the API calls

635
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,540
should always be identical.

636
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,178

637
00:38:51,178 --> 00:38:52,428
All right any other questions?

638
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:55,370

639
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: No more
Android questions?

640
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,418
All right, thank you
so much, Trevor.

641
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:02,540
[APPLAUSE]

642
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,730
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I also want
to say to the Live Stream

643
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,120
viewers out there, if you have
questions, please feel free to

644
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,810
+Mention me on Google+, ask
your questions during the

645
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,130
talk, and I'll make sure that
we get them answered on the

646
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,690
live stream.

647
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,680
I'm Timothy Jordan, by the way,
and you can find me, of

648
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,250
course, on Google+.

649
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,120
And next up, we have Johnathan
Beri, who's going to be

650
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,200
talking about Hangout Apps, and
really the next generation

651
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,450
of social applications.

652
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:37,110

653
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,392
JOHNATHAN BERI: Wait for
the screen to load.

654
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:44,788

655
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:46,670
How's everybody doing today?

656
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,590
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

657
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,380
JOHNATHAN BERI: It's a
little drier, right?

658
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,780
We planned that on purpose.

659
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,400

660
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,225
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do we have any
more Android questions while

661
00:39:59,225 --> 00:40:00,380
we're working this out?

662
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,760
Come on.

663
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,200
Who here has an Android
device?

664
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,670
You are my people.

665
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,660
Who here doesn't have
an Android device?

666
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,540
You invert probably,
most likely?

667
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,440
Except for the guy who is
actually texting on a

668
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,870
non-Android device.

669
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,940
Hi.

670
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,570
No, no worries.

671
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,430
And have you all tried
out the new ICS?

672
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,610
Have you run Ice
Cream Sandwich?

673
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,650
No?

674
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,020
Where do you try it?

675
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,567
Trevor, where do they try it?

676
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,010
TREVOR JOHNS: Next door,
at the Android House.

677
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There you go.

678
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,628
Are we ready?

679
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,540
JOHNATHAN BERI: All right,
we're good to go.

680
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,020
So now, we're going to talk
about Hangout Apps, Hangout

681
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,580
Apps being the next generation
of social apps.

682
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,730
My name is Johnathan Beri.

683
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,760
I'm a Developer Advocate working
on Google+ and Google

684
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,860
+ Hangout Apps.

685
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,820
I'll be joined shortly
by some of my

686
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,950
colleagues, Julia and Wolff.

687
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,710
But before I begin,
I want to talk a

688
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,650
little bit about Hangouts.

689
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,510
So in the audience, not
the live stream,

690
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,760
who's been in a Hangout?

691
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,160

692
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,910
Awesome.

693
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:03,150
Who's had a Hangout
with their family?

694
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,430
Strangers?

695
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,156
Bosses?

696
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:08,630
All right.

697
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,990
Drinking?

698
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,540
No, OK.

699
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,790
Sorry.

700
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,290

701
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,405
Hangouts are a new medium
of communication.

702
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:19,830
They're bringing people
together in ways that

703
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,880
telecommunication hasn't done
in the past. It's a rich,

704
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,060
immersive experience,
multi-user, 10 people at a

705
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,770
time, conversing, coming,
going, meeting,

706
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,740
shaking hands virtually.

707
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,510
And it's actually a
transformative medium.

708
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,850
It's making things happen that
was not possible before.

709
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,970
I'll give you an example.

710
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,590
Daria Musk was a small-time
performer in the forest of

711
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,920
Connecticut doing some random
gigs in New York

712
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,460
whenever she could.

713
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,410
She first heard about Google+
and got on, saw a stream, and

714
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,530
started meeting people, and
then she saw Hangouts.

715
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,412
And as a performer,
she thought,

716
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,140
what if I did a concert?

717
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,420
I know there's not a lot of
people on here yet, it's new,

718
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,100
but let's just see
what happens.

719
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,220
I'll open it up to public
and start singing.

720
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,610
Within the first hour, she
actually overloaded our

721
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,370
systems and we had to go
behind the scenes and

722
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,460
reconfigure, because there's
such an interest in listening

723
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,770
to Daria Musk perform.

724
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,020
She went on for six hours.

725
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,080
And from this small town girl
performing in New York's bars

726
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,730
to a global success.

727
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,030
Not only was she able to sing
and engage with the audience,

728
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,980
she could talk directly to the
people in the Hangout.

729
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,780
It's a way you can connect that
you could never really

730
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,068
connect before on
a global stage.

731
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,800
So it turns out, Hangouts
are really good at

732
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,430
bringing people together.

733
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,460
And when people come together,
they want to laugh, they want

734
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,900
to joke, they want to cry, but
they also want to do stuff

735
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,360
together, they want to
collaborate, they want to

736
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,940
build, they want to think.

737
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,340
And that's where Hangout
Apps come in.

738
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,720
Hangout Apps allow third party
developers to create

739
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,470
applications that are inside
the Hangout experience that

740
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,340
extend the conversation.

741
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,380
Now, what makes Hangout Apps
unique, just besides being

742
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,910
inside of this video system, is
the fact that they can be

743
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,850
real time, they're
people-centric, and they have

744
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,800
access to rich media that you
can integrate within your

745
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,020
application.

746
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,980
Let me actually stop talking
about Hangout Apps and show up

747
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,230
Hangout Apps.

748
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:35,000

749
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,775
So I'm in a standard Hangout,
and Wolff is the big screen.

750
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:45,540
Say hi, Wolff.

751
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,750
And Julia, who's actually
in the back.

752
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,000
JULIA: Hi.

753
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,470

754
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,590
JOHNATHAN BERI: Wolff, I
think you're on Mute.

755
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,840
So let me load up an app.

756
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,870

757
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,790
So what you see here is
a Hangout App running.

758
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,700
Above the film strip and below
the Menu Bar is the real

759
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,180
estate for a Hangout App.

760
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,100
Essentially, it's an i-frame.

761
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,900
You can do whatever
you want with it.

762
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,630
Of course, we have APIs that you
can integrate, which I'll

763
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,870
show in a second.

764
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,640
Now here's the idea we had.

765
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,620
We're having a lot of fun at
South by Southwest. We're

766
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,920
working hard.

767
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,870
And we decided, what can we do
to stay longer at South By?

768
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,140
So the film event
is coming up.

769
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,520
Let's submit a film into that.

770
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,350
We're going to actually use the
Hangouts and Hangout Apps

771
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,150
to collaboratively build a film
together so we can get it

772
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,860
done in record time so we
can actually party more.

773
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,900
I mean, work more.

774
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,380
So this is actually a Google
Earth plug-in.

775
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,400
If you haven't seen it, it's
a really cool plug-in, it's

776
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,560
using our 3D map data, I can
zoom around the world.

777
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,710
But for this movie, we
need to first start

778
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,790
with filming locations.

779
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:00,370
So guys, do you have any ideas
of where we should film?

780
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,860
JULIA: Well, let's see.

781
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,930
Coming from San Francisco, I
say, let's check that out.

782
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,710

783
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:14,430
WOLFF: I think we want to make
a documentary about bears, so

784
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,730
I'm going to look for
Yellowstone Park.

785
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,420
JOHNATHAN BERI: Well since I'm
in Austin, I think I'm going

786
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,045
to go there.

787
00:45:21,045 --> 00:45:24,380
So as you can see, Julia has
already put some pins on, I

788
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,480
just put a pin on.

789
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,120
And what we're demonstrating
is the social

790
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,210
piece to Hangout Apps.

791
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,340
This is a shared experience,
and our applications take

792
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,830
advantage of that and
build that in too.

793
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,250
You'll also see that I can
see what [INAUDIBLE]

794
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,000
they're doing.

795
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,990
That's because we have
an API that makes

796
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,130
real-time apps possible.

797
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,570
We call that the share state.

798
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,360
The share state is pretty
flexible, too.

799
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,260
It's not just putting pains
into Google Earth.

800
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,770
We can do a lot more with it.

801
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,940
To demonstrate, I'm
going to actually

802
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,390
start following Julia.

803
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,510
And what I'm doing is moving in
sync with what she's seeing

804
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,170
on her laptop over there.

805
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,885
So when she pans around, it
moves my globe around.

806
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,410
And it's not a screen share,
this is the actual application

807
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,850
updating in response to
what she's doing.

808
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:10,810
So to explain a little bit
further, I'm going to explain

809
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,430
how the API works.

810
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,680
Let me get out of Full Screen.

811
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:24,370

812
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,290
Finally.

813
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,540
All right.

814
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,040

815
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,390
So this is a representation of
the three different apps we

816
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,790
have running on our respective
machines, here's Julia, Wolff,

817
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,000
and I. In the bottom
there's a box.

818
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,770
This represents the
shared state.

819
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,180
It's kind of like a data store,
and it's where we store

820
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,830
the information that
we pass around.

821
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,520
So there's application code that
calls the API on Julia's

822
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,730
machine that says, hey,
I'm at the US.

823
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,790
This is the lat and
long positions.

824
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,660
And the API passes that
to our shared state,

825
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,380
and it's stored there.

826
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,890
Simple JavaScript call to send
that over, you don't have to

827
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:03,700
do crazy posts or deal with
cross-browser issues.

828
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,630
The API handles that for you.

829
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,150
Now almost instantly, the back
end sends that information to

830
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,330
all the app instances.

831
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,150
So we have three here, if we had
10, all 10 people inside

832
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,200
the Hangout would have that
same information.

833
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,240
Again, because it's our API, you
don't have to build this

834
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,260
real time back end, a pub-sub
system, dealing with set up

835
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,910
back end servers for
this piece, it

836
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,300
just happens naturally.

837
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,095
Also, you'll notice that it
goes to Julia as well.

838
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,960
It actually goes to everybody,
so you don't have to deal with

839
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,100
figuring out who sent what
message, it just gets

840
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,110
propagated.

841
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,990
Now we just have a bit of
application code that says,

842
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,180
hey Google Earth, go to that
new location, and we're

843
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:40,710
synchronized.

844
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,260
It's that simple.

845
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,565
It's about five lines of code,
10 lines of code, all in

846
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:47,710
JavaScript.

847
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,240
So now back to our
movie, because we

848
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,867
really want to stay.

849
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,670

850
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,060
I'm going to load up the second
app that we put in.

851
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:00,270

852
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,680
So guys, I don't think we have
a good handle on where we're

853
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,050
going to shoot.

854
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,740
What can we do next?

855
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,510
JULIA: We can maybe look for
some costumes to use during

856
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,280
this movie?

857
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,710
JOHNATHAN BERI: Awesome.

858
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:17,720
So we're in this Costume App,
and it's going to help us try

859
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,740
on different things.

860
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,150
So the first thing you'll notice
is I can pick any one

861
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,080
of these guys and move
my head around.

862
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,050
This is kind of silly, but what
it's doing is using our

863
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,850
media APIs.

864
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,670
So we have an overlay API that
you can attach objects to and

865
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,950
track head movements.

866
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,610
I think Wolff is demonstrating
that it pans with you.

867
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:46,130
You can also resize, like Julia
has a jumbo mustache.

868
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,890
And you could also reposition.

869
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,860
Now, these are not
canned images.

870
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,380
These are actually ones that
we've drawn and uploaded to

871
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,610
the system and overlaid
to the API.

872
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:59,250
So you can do whatever your
creativity lets you do.

873
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,760
So to prove that, we can
even draw an overlay.

874
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,920
So forgive my artistic skills on
a track pad, but I'm going

875
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,820
to draw a crown, or a Bart
Simpson hat, however you want

876
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,620
to interpret it, and I'm
going to wear it.

877
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,680

878
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,650
And we're just taking advantage
of some of the HTML5

879
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,240
features that will be
talked about later

880
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,780
today, and it's powerful.

881
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,100
And this is fun, this is a toy,
but this actually has

882
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,350
real world applications.

883
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,930

884
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,990
For example, if you're building
a Hangout App that's

885
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,400
a game, the high score might
have a number that floats up,

886
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,360
or a crown if they just
beat the level.

887
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,212
But if you're doing a
productivity app and you want

888
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:50,290
to identify who's the current
color on the project plan, you

889
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,004
can identify that with a little
ID at the bottom.

890
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:55,610

891
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:58,450
So I hate to be the bearer of
bad news with all this fun,

892
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,810
but I don't think we have budget
or time to fly or build

893
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:02,750
all these costumes.

894
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,280
Is there any way we can stay
at South by Southwest?

895
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,950
Wolff, we can't hear you.

896
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,200
What was that?

897
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,930

898
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,170
JULIA: I think maybe we can
do an animated movie.

899
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,505
What do you think, Jonathan?

900
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:15,630
JOHNATHAN BERI: Ah, yeah.

901
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,110
I'm pretty sure we built in
animated features, too.

902
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,600
JULIA: Oh, that's great.

903
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,695
That's a great idea.

904
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:20,100
OK.

905
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,050
JOHNATHAN BERI: There we are.

906
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,755
Since I've been drinking a lot
of cheap beer, I don't know

907
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:29,690
about you guys, but PBR has
been rolling deep for me.

908
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,160
So I'm going to grab this PBR.

909
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,500
Oh, wait a second.

910
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,200
Ah, I got it.

911
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,210
That's my animated character.

912
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,650
I'm a hipster.

913
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:36,080
JULIA: Aw, man.

914
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,750
But you've totally already
sold out as a hipster.

915
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,300
I mean, I got to do that before
they sold out, with my

916
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,150
blue pigtails and all.

917
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,590
JOHNATHAN BERI: Awesome.

918
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:49,710
And Wolff is miming, but I think
he wanted to be a bear

919
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,470
from the beginning with
the bear documentary.

920
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,990
So if you notice, the mouths
are moving, and that's

921
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,360
actually using our
audio-video APIs.

922
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,020
So our animated character
is responding to the

923
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,500
volume of my voice.

924
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,670
There's a simple callback API
that triggers an event that

925
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,850
animates that mouth.

926
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:12,910
And Wolff, say something as
if you're a mime again.

927
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,710
And he's growling.

928
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,680
Growl.

929
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,150
All right, cool.

930
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,650
I think we're going to have to
do this animated film, we just

931
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,840
don't have the time for it.

932
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,130
Now, this has been a mix of
useful with productivity, as

933
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,420
in using Google Earth, as
well as playfulness.

934
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,430
We can go in either direction.

935
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,740
You can build a full-fledged
game.

936
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:35,010
So as part of the film, we
built this little game to

937
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,740
represent combining all
this stuff together.

938
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,760

939
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,015
So let's go to the--

940
00:51:43,015 --> 00:51:47,732

941
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,750
I love this app.

942
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,370
So here's the premise.

943
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,540
We've been working really hard
on these demos, we were coding

944
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,870
late at the Googleplex, and
we lost track of time.

945
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:58,820
The doors are locked.

946
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,980
We can't get out.

947
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,770
And we really need to get to
South by Southwest so I can

948
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,060
give this talk.

949
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,250
So we're going to try to figure
out a way how we can

950
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,300
get out of the Google

951
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,800
headquarters and get to Austin.

952
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,590
The whole purpose is to
get into one of our

953
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,830
self-driving cars.

954
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,790
So I think I'll be the hipster,
going with the theme.

955
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,160
And here I am.

956
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,050
JULIA: You know, I really
dig these blue pigtails.

957
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:29,470
I'm going to go for
the girl here.

958
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,750
JOHNATHAN BERI: Awesome.

959
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,470
JULIA: And we know Wolff's
love of bears.

960
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:36,900
Oh, yep, there he is.

961
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,120
JOHNATHAN BERI: So first thing
I'm demonstrating here is that

962
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,450
same shared state that we used
to synchronize the globe,

963
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,220
we're actually synchronizing
our positions.

964
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,730
So if you were sitting by Julia,
you'd probably see me

965
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,870
walking around, and she's
actually moving her character

966
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,190
around her virtual world.

967
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:54,980
So to demonstrate that, we
have a little debugger.

968
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,690
Why don't you guys
move around?

969
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,690
So this information is
what's being stored

970
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,370
in the shared state.

971
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,700
It's just [INAUDIBLE]
with positions

972
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,760
and some other metadata.

973
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,640
And we've also carried over the
audio API effect, so our

974
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,220
mouths are still animated.

975
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,170
And that, we have a little
debugger for that, too.

976
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,930
This represents the volume of
my mic and the others' mics,

977
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,450
and that's what our animate
character is responding to.

978
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,525
Again, that's just a simple
hook into the API.

979
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:24,170

980
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,420
Now hey guys, do you have
any ideas how we

981
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,080
can get out of here?

982
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,830
JULIA: Well, I've heard that
we can map our way out of

983
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,300
here, but we kind of need to
know where we are, right?

984
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,350
JOHNATHAN BERI: Oh, let me go
over to the kiosk, do a little

985
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,300
Google search.

986
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,010
Boom.

987
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,110
Whoa.

988
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,320
Sensitive.

989
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,630
I think we're in Mountain
View, so let me look for

990
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,810
Mountain View.

991
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,055
JULIA: That sounds like
a good start.

992
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:54,102
JOHNATHAN BERI: I'm
feeling lucky.

993
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:57,811
All right, so let me double
click and zoom in, and--

994
00:53:57,811 --> 00:53:58,870
whoa!

995
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,876
Wolff, where did you go?

996
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:02,294
Boom.

997
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:04,375
All right, I guess we
found one way out.

998
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:07,130
JULIA: Wolff has really
good aim.

999
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,430
JOHNATHAN BERI: How are
you in the Hangout,

1000
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,600
but also in the car?

1001
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,140
I don't know, we'll figure
it out later.

1002
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,840
JULIA: You know Johnathan, I'm
really thirsty after that.

1003
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,520
That was really stressful.

1004
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,770
So I'm going to get a soda.

1005
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,150

1006
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,505
JOHNATHAN BERI: Sure.

1007
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:22,740
I'll grab a Mentos
or something.

1008
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,240
JULIA: Yeah.

1009
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,063
Let's just take a break and
figure out the next steps.

1010
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:28,300
JOHNATHAN BERI: Hey,
wait a second.

1011
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,550
Mentos?

1012
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,755
Diet Coke?

1013
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:32,740
Do you know what I'm thinking?

1014
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,240
JULIA: I think I'm thinking
what you're thinking.

1015
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,560
I think I need to strap this
absurdly large bottle of Diet

1016
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,366
Coke to my back like a rocket.

1017
00:54:41,366 --> 00:54:42,220
Oh yeah.

1018
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,200
JOHNATHAN BERI: Betcha
there'll be a

1019
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,900
lot of fuel in that.

1020
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:47,720
OK, so if I just splash
in some Mentos--

1021
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,000
JULIA: Yep.

1022
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,232
JOHNATHAN BERI: Boom!

1023
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:52,440
Wait, are you there?

1024
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,930
Did get in the car?

1025
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,180
JULIA: Whoa.

1026
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,650

1027
00:54:58,650 --> 00:54:59,710
JOHNATHAN BERI: And
that was fun.

1028
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:02,380
All right, so I'm the
last man standing.

1029
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,570
Um, I need to get out.

1030
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,470
How do I get out of here?

1031
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,350
There's got to be, I don't know,
like a door or something

1032
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:13,020
that we don't know about?

1033
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,040
JULIA: I think that a door
probably should've been our

1034
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,685
first guess, but I think
you should try it out.

1035
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:20,790
JOHNATHAN BERI: Oh yeah,
that's right.

1036
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,222
I'll use the search.

1037
00:55:23,222 --> 00:55:27,950
Let's see, door.

1038
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,970
I think we have one of those.

1039
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,930
Oh, that's great.

1040
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,180
Open sesame.

1041
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:39,198

1042
00:55:39,198 --> 00:55:39,985
Did it work?

1043
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:42,900
I feel like I'm in the
Twilight Zone.

1044
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,050
Ah, there we go.

1045
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,090
No we're off to Austin.

1046
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,670
Dum, dum, dum.

1047
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,390
Well that was fun, right?

1048
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,030
It was playful, and that shows
some of lighter sides of

1049
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:54,720
Hangout Apps.

1050
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,930
But the Hangout Apps can kind go
across the entire spectrum.

1051
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,070
Since it's really an i-frame for
you to work and integrate

1052
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,770
with into, as developers, you
can do everything from

1053
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:11,410
productivity apps, to music
collaboration apps, to

1054
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,980
research and discovery.

1055
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,030
But of course, games too.

1056
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,490
The Hangout Apps, because
they're social, because

1057
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,400
they're real time, and because
they have access to this media

1058
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,800
that brings people together,
it's a new generation of

1059
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,670
social apps.

1060
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,290
This is also a new frontier.

1061
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,420
We're in Developer Preview,
and we're working our way

1062
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,360
towards out of that.

1063
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,020
So that you can be first on
board to bring your apps

1064
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,650
inside of Hangouts.

1065
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:42,210
And I think that's it.

1066
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,210
One second, sorry.

1067
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:44,460
My final slide.

1068
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,830

1069
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,330
I go into any code today, so
we have a code lab in the

1070
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,740
afternoon that you'll
actually build.

1071
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,170
Sit down, in three hours by the
end, you should have our

1072
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,400
canned app and anything that
you can come up with.

1073
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,000
We'll go through the nitty
gritty of code, answer

1074
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,690
questions, go through demos.

1075
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,220
And you'll become Hangout
App ninjas.

1076
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,450
And then finally, our developer
site has the

1077
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,680
documentation that you need to
research if you're on the live

1078
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,750
stream, and that's
developers.google.com/+, as in

1079
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,690
the plus symbol, hangouts.

1080
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,895
And those are our Google+
profile links, so

1081
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,665
you can circle us.

1082
00:57:22,665 --> 00:57:23,810
Some more questions?

1083
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:24,170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

1084
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,300
Thank you, Johnathan.

1085
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,580
JOHNATHAN BERI: You're
welcome.

1086
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And we're going
to actually have YouTube

1087
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,270
come up and start plugging in
their laptops while you bring

1088
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,830
down yours and we answer
a few questions.

1089
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,460
And we have a question from the
internet first. A lot of

1090
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,940
people out there on
the internet.

1091
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,740
And they would like to know,
Jonathan, if they'll be able

1092
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,650
to change the whole layout
of the Hangout

1093
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,260
Window with the API.

1094
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,910
JOHNATHAN BERI: Currently,
we don't allow ability to

1095
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,350
customize the layout.

1096
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,420
We just have APIs that detect
things about the layout.

1097
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,570
So for example, if the chat pane
is open, you have an API

1098
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,870
to know about that.

1099
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:58,130
Whether a user's using the app,
so if they've switched

1100
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,300
off the app and they're just in
the Hangout, you can detect

1101
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,570
things like that.

1102
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:02,870
That's a great feedback.

1103
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,820
We've heard that from a few
people, and we're looking for

1104
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,550
ways to sort of customize
the experience

1105
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,820
a little bit further.

1106
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

1107
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,560
Do we have any questions from
the audience, the live in

1108
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,980
here, in person audience?

1109
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,825
I can see you in front of me,
and I can start to pressure

1110
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:19,100
you for questions
if you'd like.

1111
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,350
Oh, question over here.

1112
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,760

1113
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,250
MALE SPEAKER: We use
Live Stream a lot

1114
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,820
on the YouTube side.

1115
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,230
So one of the benefits of using
Live Stream is being

1116
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,080
able to put in pre-rolls
and mid-rolls.

1117
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,690
Is it possible to do the same
on the Hangout Side?

1118
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:38,730
JOHNATHAN BERI: So pre-rolls
and post-rolls.

1119
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,450
There are some APIs around
muting somebody's video feed,

1120
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,670
so you can black.

1121
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:48,592
We also have APIs do avatars,
so static images.

1122
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,770
I don't know if we had it in
this demo, but you can

1123
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,220
actually even animate the
overlays, so you can display a

1124
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,010
roll on top of the video feed,
it gets propagated over for

1125
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,780
that particular person's feed,
and as part of the API, you

1126
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,860
can integrate with that.

1127
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,010
In terms of injecting right into
the feed, the APIs are

1128
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,420
not there yet, but the overlays
are certainly

1129
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,360
something you could do.

1130
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:09,690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

1131
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,900
We have time for maybe one
or two more questions if

1132
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,530
anybody's curious about Hangout
applications or

1133
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:18,450
Hangouts in general, or what
Johnathan's favorite

1134
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:21,250
restaurant in Texas is.

1135
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,250
No?

1136
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:22,750
MALE SPEAKER: Which is?

1137
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What is your
favorite restaurant in Texas?

1138
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,610
JOHNATHAN BERI: I've
only been to two.

1139
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:26,710
IHOP and--

1140
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,900
oh, three.

1141
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,760
All right, the Moonshine one is
over around the corner, or

1142
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,100
Moonshiners?

1143
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:32,830
It's pretty good.

1144
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,540
All right, thanks everybody.

1145
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,391
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

1146
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:56,020
[APPLAUSE]

1147
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, and I'm
sorry, I didn't introduce you.

1148
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:01,150
Which, that's absurd of me.

1149
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:01,720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm
waiting for you.

1150
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
ridiculous.

1151
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,410
You're going to be talking about
YouTube APIs and video

1152
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:08,490
creation and curation, and some
pretty cool new stuff.

1153
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:10,260
And you've got a lot of friends
with you, don't you?

1154
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes, I do
have a lot of friends.

1155
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,000
Hi, everyone.

1156
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,280
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

1157
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,890
I work for YouTube.

1158
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,530
And we'll be talking about
mobile content

1159
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:21,580
curation and creation.

1160
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,370
Quick question.

1161
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:26,130
Who in the audience develops
mobile apps or

1162
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,920
has a mobile strategy?

1163
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,310
And who doesn't?

1164
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:31,640
OK.

1165
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,500
If you don't, then maybe you
should go get a drink.

1166
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,710
Otherwise, this might be quite
interesting for you.

1167
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:41,720
So here's the agenda
for today.

1168
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,790
We'll talk about the
opportunity, what's happening

1169
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:46,815
in YouTube mobile, and then talk
about creation, curation.

1170
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:49,290
So I'll talk about the APIs
that we have to enable

1171
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,950
applications, then give you
examples of these applications

1172
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:56,130
directly from our partners, and
then we'll talk a little

1173
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,700
bit about consumption.

1174
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,770
Now a warning.

1175
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:03,630
We have nine demos, 20 minutes,
six companies will be

1176
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,900
presenting, so this is going
to be a lightning talk,

1177
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,100
lightning demo session.

1178
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,390
Hopefully, we'll try to maximize
your time here.

1179
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:15,270
So forgive me if we are going
super fast, but a lot of us

1180
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,900
will be hanging out
later on today.

1181
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,310
So you have any questions after
this, please feel free

1182
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,700
to stop by.

1183
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,220
Before we start, I would like to
give a shout out to people

1184
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,800
on iStream, YouTube iStream,
since I know we quite a few

1185
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,440
people watching as well.

1186
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,280
All right.

1187
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,050
So let's talk about
the opportunities.

1188
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,750
Here's some stats that you
might find interesting.

1189
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,980
We are having about four billion
views on YouTube

1190
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:47,600
daily, out of which in 2010, we
had about 200 mobile views.

1191
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:52,930
Last year, you can think about
how many we had if you have

1192
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:56,160
any guesses, but actually,
the number was 600.

1193
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,110
So the mobile traffic
has tripled.

1194
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:03,450
Similarly for uploads, we're
getting 60 hours of video

1195
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:08,240
uploaded to YouTube every
minute, out of which three

1196
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,020
hours are coming from mobile
devices, and that number is

1197
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:17,820
also growing very fast, which
brings us to creation.

1198
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,050
We will actually have demos from
Avid, WeVideo, who are

1199
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:25,290
here, and I'll show an
application from Vlix.

1200
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:26,430
First, let's start
with the API.

1201
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:30,530
So if you are building mobile
applications and you would

1202
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:33,140
like to incorporate video
uploads to YouTube in your

1203
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,720
app, you need to think
about authentication.

1204
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,420
We prefer OAuth2.

1205
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,200
It's your friend.

1206
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:43,300
Client Login works, but it's
bad, it has a lot of issues.

1207
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,390
Connections will probably drop
while you're uploading.

1208
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,440
We do support resumable uploads,
so for those of you

1209
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,960
that have used it, that should
be pretty straightforward.

1210
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,480
If you haven't used it, it'll
allow you to pick up

1211
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,430
where you left off.

1212
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:57,455
Metadata is important, so make
sure that your uploads

1213
01:02:57,455 --> 01:02:59,530
actually have the metadata
associated with it because

1214
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,320
that helps us with video
discovery and recommendation.

1215
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,260
You need a developer key from
YouTube because that'll help

1216
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:09,220
you analyze your uploads and
get additional analytics on

1217
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,820
the actual performance
of the application.

1218
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:16,040
And there's a little secret I
would like to share with you

1219
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,620
that is pretty frequently
overlooked.

1220
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,050
If you need application-specific
metadata

1221
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,850
included in your upload, you can
actually use our developer

1222
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:27,800
tags feature to associate
metadata that is only visible

1223
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,340
to your application.

1224
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,790
So next, we'll have a demo
from WeVideo, one of our

1225
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:35,760
application YouTube
API partners.

1226
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,060
I would like to invite John to
come up here and give a quick

1227
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,743
overview of the company,
as well as the demo.

1228
01:03:40,743 --> 01:03:43,780
All right, go for it, and
you have two minutes.

1229
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,715
JOHN CANNING: Right,
two minutes.

1230
01:03:44,715 --> 01:03:46,630
That's a lightning round
[INAUDIBLE].

1231
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:47,880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Maybe three.

1232
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,850

1233
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:50,420
JOHN CANNING: Greetings,
everybody.

1234
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,390
I'm John Canney with WeVideo.

1235
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:55,200
WeVideo is an online
collaborative video editing

1236
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,290
platform, and I am about to put
all those words together

1237
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,350
in one sentence.

1238
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:01,910
The reason is because that's
exactly what we do.

1239
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:06,430
We are hosted in a browser, but
now also, running on our

1240
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,570
mobile phones.

1241
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,810
We're collaborative, so your
friends can work together,

1242
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,220
share video from any part of
the world, just like we saw

1243
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,040
earlier with the Google+
example.

1244
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,970
We're doing it with
video editing.

1245
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:21,190
And then, having the real time
One Touch export out to some

1246
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,310
of your favorite services.

1247
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,290
Ours happened to be YouTube.

1248
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,040
So let me show you a demo.

1249
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,730
That's a whole lot more
meaningful than

1250
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,800
talking about it.

1251
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,710
So the first thing is, I've
got my mobile phone.

1252
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,770
Now the nice thing is, what I'm
going to do, I'm going to

1253
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,660
go ahead and capture a picture
here of you fine people in the

1254
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,260
crowd, lovely.

1255
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,630
Thank you.

1256
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,700
Thank you all for sitting
still on your laptops.

1257
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,710
That's appreciated.

1258
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,170
And then I'm going to
go ahead and upload

1259
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,060
my media right there.

1260
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:50,380
So what I'm doing is I'm now
uploading it into a project

1261
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,920
that I created for everybody
to share at South by

1262
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,110
Southwest. So that's
one side of it.

1263
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:58,910
This is released now in the App
Store, able to get it on

1264
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:01,810
your smartphones and start
contributing and collecting.

1265
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:03,560
That's one side of it.

1266
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,260
The next side of it
is let's edit it.

1267
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,920
So this is going to
be coming soon.

1268
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,690
It's the tablet form
of our editor.

1269
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,220
And so what you now have is
all the stuff I've been

1270
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,270
uploading, all the stuff my
friend Yostein has been

1271
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,620
uploading, but in
an Editor Form.

1272
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:21,340
So I can sit there, go ahead
and play with it.

1273
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,960
We can notice the unfortunately,
we don't have

1274
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,590
that exciting weather here, as
she was commenting earlier,

1275
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,370
freezing out there,
the poor thing.

1276
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:30,560
But this is the power
of the platform.

1277
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,180
So you're shooting it on one
platform, editing it on

1278
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,170
another, and sharing
it with friends.

1279
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,880
And then when I'm done, going
ahead, one touch, pushing it

1280
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:38,520
to YouTube.

1281
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,400
So thank you very much,
we're WeVideo.

1282
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,815
[APPLAUSE]

1283
01:05:42,815 --> 01:05:44,065
JOHN CANNING: Thank you, Art.

1284
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:48,070

1285
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

1286
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,170

1287
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:52,390
Thank you, John.

1288
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,756
Now we'll have a
demo from Avid.

1289
01:05:54,756 --> 01:05:57,516
Who in the audience has
heard about Avid?

1290
01:05:57,516 --> 01:05:58,770
You're doing video editing?

1291
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:01,240
Yeah, a fair amount
of hands up.

1292
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,320
And I'd like to introduce
[INAUDIBLE] from Avid, who is

1293
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,138
going to tell us about
the company and

1294
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:08,790
give us a quick demo.

1295
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,040
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

1296
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,964

1297
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:16,450
about a month ago, and I'm
going to very, very

1298
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,700
briefly show you--

1299
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:32,884

1300
01:06:32,884 --> 01:06:36,868
I'm going to very briefly show
you how you can do big screen

1301
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,860
editing on your [INAUDIBLE]
using the

1302
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,852
Avid Studio for iPad.

1303
01:06:40,852 --> 01:06:44,338

1304
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,334
There we go.

1305
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:49,567
Avid Studio for iPad, it's very
intuitive, you just open

1306
01:06:49,567 --> 01:06:50,812
up a new project.

1307
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:53,053
You don't even have to
name it right away if

1308
01:06:53,053 --> 01:06:54,298
you don't want to.

1309
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:57,037
I'm going to pull some clips
from my video library down

1310
01:06:57,037 --> 01:06:58,282
into the storyboard.

1311
01:06:58,282 --> 01:07:03,760
I don't have to worry about the
order that I put them in,

1312
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,499
because it's going to be easy
to rearrange [INAUDIBLE] in

1313
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:07,246
the storyboard.

1314
01:07:07,246 --> 01:07:08,496
[INAUDIBLE].

1315
01:07:08,496 --> 01:07:13,720

1316
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:19,696
I can also capture video and
pictures from within the app.

1317
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:21,170
I'm going to put a still picture
from the airplane

1318
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:25,020
yesterday down into the
storyboard, and I can add a

1319
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:31,957
bit of Ken Burns effect on it
by doing a pan and zoom.

1320
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:34,628
There we go.

1321
01:07:34,628 --> 01:07:41,146
We have some transitions here,
A to B. Also, I like the

1322
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:43,900
little [INAUDIBLE] fade there,
so I'm going to put it in

1323
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,173
between my picture and video
clips, just to create smooth

1324
01:07:47,173 --> 01:07:48,159
transitions.

1325
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:52,103
I can also put some standard
title in here.

1326
01:07:52,103 --> 01:07:53,582
This is [INAUDIBLE].

1327
01:07:53,582 --> 01:08:08,372

1328
01:08:08,372 --> 01:08:11,314
I can move that around, maybe
there [INAUDIBLE].

1329
01:08:11,314 --> 01:08:23,130

1330
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,660
--one that I really like, so I'm
going to put that at the

1331
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,976
end of our storyboard.

1332
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:31,350
Since we're talking about being
your own personal VJ,

1333
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:36,750
I'm going to call it like
it is, Wahoo YouTube.

1334
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:41,936

1335
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:43,609
There we go.

1336
01:08:43,609 --> 01:08:45,890
I can also make that bigger.

1337
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:50,229
And wouldn't it be nice if that
just was overlaid on top

1338
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:52,800
of that last clip, that
last video clip?

1339
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,229
I'm going to go ahead
and do that.

1340
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:57,540
It wouldn't be complete
without music.

1341
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:03,939
My iTunes library is right here,
so I can pull any track

1342
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,939
onto the timeline.

1343
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,340
You've got three channels there
for audio, so if you

1344
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,972
wanted to do music and overdub,
and if you wanted to

1345
01:09:12,972 --> 01:09:15,490
put some Foley in there, however
you want to do it.

1346
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,510
It's just as easy to edit
the music channels

1347
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,399
as it is the video.

1348
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,120
I'm going to make a clean
edit there, get rid of

1349
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,382
the excess, and bang.

1350
01:09:28,382 --> 01:09:29,632
We have a video.

1351
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:35,543

1352
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:37,470
There we go.

1353
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,740
It gets smoother
as you render.

1354
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:41,160
We don't even have time for that
today but it is a very

1355
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,100
fast render.

1356
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,902
And once you're done with that,
you're going to put it

1357
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:47,380
right onto YouTube.

1358
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:48,630
Simple, simple [INAUDIBLE].

1359
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:52,775

1360
01:09:52,775 --> 01:09:54,200
There we go.

1361
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,182
And that is Avid Studio
for iPad.

1362
01:09:57,182 --> 01:10:23,240
[APPLAUSE]

1363
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And if we
can switch back to the

1364
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:26,820
projection screen?

1365
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:30,560

1366
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,680
OK, so demo in this
category, Vlix.

1367
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,810
It's a mobile app for
smartphones that allows you to

1368
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:40,590
do video anything and special
effects right

1369
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:41,900
there on your device.

1370
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,540
Vlix is an API partner
of YouTube.

1371
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,480
They also have a web app
on YouTube.com/create.

1372
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,250
And let's switch to the iPad
that I have here to give you a

1373
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,500
quick demo.

1374
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,650

1375
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:59,260
So the way it works, you can
actually shoot a video right

1376
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:03,140
from the device, as you would
expect so I'm just going to go

1377
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,120
ahead and do it.

1378
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,870
Here, hello, there's the bar.

1379
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:10,160
How's it going?

1380
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:10,910
All right.

1381
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,890
And then I like the video,
so I'm just going to go

1382
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,990
ahead and use it.

1383
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,120
We can add a couple of effects,
so let me just

1384
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:25,440
improve the contrast on it,
maybe I'll make it black and

1385
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,400
white right here.

1386
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,650
And then--

1387
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:33,190

1388
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:35,910
you can't see the demo?

1389
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,980
It's coming back?

1390
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:39,870
MALE SPEAKER: We have
you on here.

1391
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:40,226
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

1392
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:41,476
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you
check your cables?

1393
01:11:41,476 --> 01:11:44,220

1394
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,490
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Maybe
cable problem?

1395
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:47,830
Should we switch
to our backup?

1396
01:11:47,830 --> 01:12:09,360

1397
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:09,810
OK.

1398
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,810
So you guys can see that.

1399
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:18,240
Once I apply the effect, I can
hit Next, and then share it to

1400
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,740
my social network, my
YouTube account.

1401
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,990
So it's pretty straightforward.

1402
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:25,440

1403
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,045
OK, let's switch back to the
presentation screen.

1404
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:32,570

1405
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:34,920
So we will now talk
about Curation.

1406
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,390
Curation is very important to
us, and we have been adding a

1407
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:40,880
lot of API support
to improve it.

1408
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,130
So if you're building a curation
app, what's important

1409
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:47,340
is search capability, again,
exposed via the APIs.

1410
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,720
You can find out what content
is related to a given video

1411
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,050
that your user is playing.

1412
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,590
Watch_later, you can discover
what has been saved for

1413
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:56,900
watching, you can discover
programmatically

1414
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,500
what has been watched.

1415
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,560
Trends and there's more APIs
coming, so if you're

1416
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,350
interested in this category,
I'll be around later and

1417
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,780
tomorrow, talk to me.

1418
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:08,560
And now we're going to have a
couple of more demos, starting

1419
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,810
with Squrl.

1420
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:15,160

1421
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,890
So let's try this [INAUDIBLE].

1422
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:25,390

1423
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:25,540
MARK: Hi.

1424
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:31,146
So I'm Mark, this is Michael,
we're co-founders of Squrl.

1425
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:35,630
At Squrl, trying to be the best
place to discover and

1426
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:37,210
watch video on your
mobile device.

1427
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:40,090

1428
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:44,130
Right now, we're available for
the iPhone and the iPad.

1429
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:46,770
We've been featured in the New
and Noteworthy Section of the

1430
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:49,440
App Store and achieved the
rank of Number Six in

1431
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,740
Entertainment Apps.

1432
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:58,020
We have millions and millions
of videos in our system,

1433
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,140
thousands of feeds, hundreds of
providers, YouTube by far

1434
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:07,580
being the largest.

1435
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,140
Having said all that, at the
end of the day, what we're

1436
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,240
trying to do for our users is
get them to videos that they

1437
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,110
care about.

1438
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:14,030
So how do we do that?

1439
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:17,860
At Squrl, the first thing that
you do when you come in to our

1440
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,570
app is we allow you to
personalize your video

1441
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:22,190
experience.

1442
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:25,310
So you have the ability to
select from all the providers

1443
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,670
that we have. These providers
match up to certain given

1444
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:31,061
interest categories
inside of Squrl.

1445
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:34,909

1446
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:36,352
MALE SPEAKER: Can we switch
to the overhead?

1447
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:43,090

1448
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:49,350
MARK: So for example, we have
technology, and Michael can go

1449
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:53,720
through and add in different
providers that map to those

1450
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,090
interest categories, news--

1451
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:00,546
Wall Street Journal, CBS
News, New York Times--

1452
01:15:00,546 --> 01:15:04,922
it's basically building a
personalized channel guide.

1453
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:08,610
And when he's done with that,
he can get into our Fresh

1454
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:11,840
section, give you a little
tutorial on how to use the

1455
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,670
app, but you come into our Fresh
section, which is the

1456
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,090
latest and greatest videos from
all the providers you

1457
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,650
just selected put into a dynamic
playlist in that

1458
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,880
interest category.

1459
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,810
So you can simply, he'll select
from Comedy, you can

1460
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:28,990
start watching video across all
those different providers

1461
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,030
in a very nice, laid-back way.

1462
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:33,920
Inside of Squrl, you can share
videos across your different

1463
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,880
social networks, you can like a
video on Squrl, you can add

1464
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,130
to your queue to watch later.

1465
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:41,730

1466
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:44,160
We also have a section
called What's Hot.

1467
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,990
What's Hot is essentially
trending video that's trending

1468
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:51,320
across all those different
providers that we're tracking

1469
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,030
and all the different
social networks.

1470
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:58,880
And finally, you're able to sign
in or authenticate with

1471
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,310
your YouTube account, Netflix
account, Twitter, or Facebook.

1472
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:04,680
And if you sign in with your
social networks, you're

1473
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,550
actually able to share video
directly and message directly

1474
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:12,230
with your friends as well as see
their activity inside of

1475
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:15,630
Squrl and use them as a jump-off
point for video.

1476
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,310
So thank you for having
us to YouTube.

1477
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,660
We really enjoy working with
their team and their APIs.

1478
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:30,460
[APPLAUSE]

1479
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

1480
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,380
And I would like to invite
Hannah from LinkTV to talk

1481
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,310
about LinkTV and give
us a demo as well.

1482
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:37,300
Thanks, Hannah.

1483
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,550
HANNAH EAVES: Thanks.

1484
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:43,240

1485
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:43,360
Hey, everyone.

1486
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,330
I'm from LinkTV. LinkTV
is a national--

1487
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:50,750

1488
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,430
I guess we're going to switch
right to the demo.

1489
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:53,180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nope,
go ahead.

1490
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:53,900
HANNAH EAVES: OK, all right.

1491
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,480
LinkTV is a national satellite
TV station, about 33 million

1492
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,040
US households.

1493
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,800
We've won a Peabody Award for
curating and translating

1494
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,720
Middle Eastern online and for
broadcast. And so basically

1495
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,220
what we've done is we've done
a bunch of digital projects,

1496
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:12,570
including a news website that
takes this kind of curation

1497
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:15,910
and translation global and
brings them all onto a website

1498
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:18,575
and into some mobile apps that
I'm going to demo here, that

1499
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:21,520
are still kind of in the
prototyping stage.

1500
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,020
So what we do basically is about
80% of the content we

1501
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,520
curate is from YouTube and plays
through the YouTube API.

1502
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,530
About 20% we produce
ourselves.

1503
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:32,180
So we have environmental
programming, we cover Asia,

1504
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,280
Asian bloggers, video
bloggers.

1505
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,390
And then we perform natural
language processing on YouTube

1506
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:39,990
videos to pull out automatically
peoples, places,

1507
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:41,360
organizations.

1508
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,710
We use Zymanta as a partner
for that piece.

1509
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:47,820
And then we use that to do a
live search to create related

1510
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,130
content on the fly.

1511
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:53,100
So I'm going to switch
to the demo now.

1512
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,270
If you want to sign up for this
app when it comes out in

1513
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,860
summer, you can go to
linktvapps.com, and there's an

1514
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,710
invite list there.

1515
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:04,380
So here we have basically, kind
of your Home Screen, a

1516
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,690
curated list you can see, from
all sorts of different

1517
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:10,036
sources, Al Jazeera
English, ITN.

1518
01:18:10,036 --> 01:18:11,910
We've got our own programming
here through

1519
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:13,695
Earth Focus, Link Asia.

1520
01:18:13,695 --> 01:18:17,440
We're also using these tags so
that you can see when we offer

1521
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,010
the local perspective,
which is kind of one

1522
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,390
of our unique offerings.

1523
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:23,760
So here you see the Iranian
election form PressTV, so

1524
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,800
that's the Iranian state

1525
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,490
broadcaster that we're offering.

1526
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:30,425
And then we have also, we're
looking at the best raw video

1527
01:18:30,425 --> 01:18:33,380
that you can see every
day based on what's

1528
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,150
happening in the news.

1529
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,360
So I'm just going to jump
into a video here.

1530
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,210
So here's everyone knows about
the KONY video, this is like

1531
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:42,740
the biggest thing right now.

1532
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:45,340
But you can see here, we've
got related information.

1533
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,370
You might not know
who Kony is.

1534
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,770
So we do in an automated way.

1535
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,250
So we're enhancing kind of
YouTube's metadata by creating

1536
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,790
our own set of metadata.

1537
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:56,700
So Kony, Uganda, International
Criminal Court, and then we

1538
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,160
also kind of bring in related
content from other sources,

1539
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:04,690
articles, tweets, social
media, and other videos

1540
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,770
related to this video.

1541
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:09,560
So this is kind of just
the beginning.

1542
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,960
We also are building
out Map features.

1543
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,880
And there we go.

1544
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,010
There's kind of a preview of
kind of what the Map feature

1545
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:21,223
is going to look like, and you
can check it out in summer.

1546
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,473
Thanks.

1547
01:19:22,473 --> 01:19:28,770

1548
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:30,090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

1549
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,480
Is that yours?

1550
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:31,880
HANNAH EAVES:: Yeah.

1551
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

1552
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,900
Thanks, Hannah.

1553
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,750
Next up is business.me.

1554
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,873
It's a very interesting
spin of curation.

1555
01:19:40,873 --> 01:19:42,123
OSCAR MORENO: Thank you.

1556
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:44,520

1557
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,220
OK, so we are business.me.

1558
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,770
We are a personalized business
video network.

1559
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:52,280
We focus on videos about
business topics, and we do

1560
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,360
three things.

1561
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,520
We do curation, we have an
editorial team that selects

1562
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,930
the best business videos and
organizes the videos in

1563
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,230
different sectors.

1564
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,010
We do personalization.

1565
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:08,250
We use LinkedIn to tailor make
your views, depending on your

1566
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,810
professional interests and
depending on your professional

1567
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,040
connections.

1568
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,510
And we promote the contribution
of business

1569
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:19,550
videos by allowing users and
companies to upload video or

1570
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:20,690
share video.

1571
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:25,920
So let's go to the demo, the
mobile web app is a prototype.

1572
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,510
We have focused on the
consumption of video.

1573
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:29,940
So you have several
views here.

1574
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,065
The first one is the Editorial
Picks, which is our curation

1575
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:36,920
effort where we select the best
videos from the web about

1576
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,090
business topics.

1577
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:41,060
Then you can go into your view
and you can sign in with

1578
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:44,120
LinkedIn, and that way, we can
read your professional

1579
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,330
interest. Also, what you
connections are watching in

1580
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:50,620
business.me or are sharing, and
we can recommend videos

1581
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,960
according to that information.

1582
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:00,100
And you can also go to different
sectors and browse

1583
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,520
and choose the sector you have
interest, for example,

1584
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,580
development and design, and
choose a video here from

1585
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:11,120
Google developers, and watch
video in the iPad.

1586
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,030
So that's business.me.

1587
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:15,190
It's a personalized
business channel.

1588
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:18,030
And it's the best place to
share and discover videos

1589
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:18,930
about business topics.

1590
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,180
Thank you.

1591
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:24,272

1592
01:21:24,272 --> 01:21:24,740
[APPLAUSE]

1593
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great pitch.

1594
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,810
Short and sweet.

1595
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:31,040
Next up is ShortForm, and I have
to say that ShortForm has

1596
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,460
inspired the title
of this talk, The

1597
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,680
Video in Your Pocket.

1598
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,993
Jeremy and Alex.

1599
01:21:35,993 --> 01:21:39,700

1600
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,840
JEREME MONTEAU: Thanks, Jarek.

1601
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:41,850
Hey, everybody.

1602
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,600
I'm Jereme, a co-founder and
lead developer at ShortForm.

1603
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,020
And this is Alex,
whose official

1604
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,110
title is Tallest Engineer.

1605
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:52,260
At ShortForm, we're all about
VJs, and turning viewers into

1606
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,860
VJs, and helping them create
amazing channels.

1607
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,130
VJs curate channels on ShortForm
just by watching

1608
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,570
videos and clicking a button.

1609
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:03,550
They can then share those
channels with their social

1610
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:07,800
networks via email, and a
variety of different ways.

1611
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,840
They can also embed their
channels on their website with

1612
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,630
our embeddable widget.

1613
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:16,900
Viewers can then watch channels
at ShortForm by

1614
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,650
clicking on that the links
that they get.

1615
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:21,376
The videos can come from
YouTube, Hulu, and a variety

1616
01:22:21,376 --> 01:22:22,980
of other sources.

1617
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,030
They can watch on all screens,
including TV or on Google TV,

1618
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:30,760
we're a spotlight app there, the
desktop obviously, and now

1619
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,970
tablet and mobile, which we're
going to give you an early

1620
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:34,220
preview of today.

1621
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,970

1622
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:38,970
The first step to bring
ShortForm to mobile is

1623
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,160
providing a first class
viewing experience.

1624
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,250
So now, when mobile users click
through ShortForm links,

1625
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,760
they'll receive a mobile
optimized web application.

1626
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,870
This is a channel about one of
my favorite subjects, my son.

1627
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:57,320
So videos will play in their
embedded players in the page.

1628
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,920
As users scroll down the page,
more videos will load, and

1629
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,710
they can see the
whole channel.

1630
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:08,010
So the next step to bringing
ShortForm to mobile is going

1631
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,335
to be allowing curation directly
from the mobile app.

1632
01:23:10,335 --> 01:23:12,950
This is an early preview
as well.

1633
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:15,470
People are going to be able to
click on Add, choose a channel

1634
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,280
to put the video in,
and they're done.

1635
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,300
They can then share those
channels with their audience

1636
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,550
just by clicking on Share from
them mobile app as well, and

1637
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:25,720
then viewers will get the
first class viewing

1638
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:26,890
experience.

1639
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:30,670
So I encourage all of you
to go become VJs today.

1640
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,870
We're excited to announce that
we've opened up a weekly VJ

1641
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:34,880
competition, so if your channel
is one of the top

1642
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,980
performing channels on the
sites, you're eligible for

1643
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:37,820
cash prizes.

1644
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,350
So be heard, be a VJ.

1645
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,090
Thank you very much.

1646
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:49,230
[APPLAUSE]

1647
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:49,580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK.

1648
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:52,950
And then last but not least, I
wanted to chat a little bit

1649
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:56,580
about video consumption and what
we're doing in this area

1650
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,190
to enable applications.

1651
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:01,180
So all the apps that you have
seen use our player, our

1652
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:02,460
player API.

1653
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,320
And on mobile specifically, we
have an iPhone player, which

1654
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,470
allows you to actually embed the
video playback in a native

1655
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,760
mobile application, so on
Android, in the web view, on

1656
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,160
IOS, in UI web view.

1657
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,170
The Object Embed is another
mechanism, it's a legacy

1658
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:19,190
mechanism that still works,
specific to Safari, it's done

1659
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:22,180
through Safari plug-in,
mobile Safari.

1660
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:24,910
Obviously, you can launch the
YouTube application on the

1661
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,670
mobile device if you wish.

1662
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,930
Typically, it comes
pre-installed with the OS.

1663
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,090
And then there's more coming.

1664
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:32,760
We have a Code Lab at 3:00 PM,
so some of you in the audience

1665
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,860
have signed up for
that Code Lab.

1666
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,880
The Code Lab is full, but it'll
actually be dedicated to

1667
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,250
improving the video playback
experience for mobile.

1668
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:43,440
So I have two quick demos from
two companies that couldn't be

1669
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,180
here today that really do very
interesting stuff when it

1670
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,360
comes to optimizing the
playback experience.

1671
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,630
ShowYou is one of them.

1672
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:53,550
It was ranked Best
Social Networking

1673
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,890
App in the App Store.

1674
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:59,380
And then the next company
is NowBox, which is a

1675
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,320
personalized guide that really
allows you to discover

1676
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,080
interesting content on YouTube
and present your own

1677
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,260
subscriptions in a way that
is very easy to consume.

1678
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,590
So let's switch to the demo.

1679
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:21,600

1680
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,260
Starting with ShowYou.

1681
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:28,630
So as you see, what ShowYou does
is presents videos on the

1682
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:31,570
wall that actually can
be discovered by

1683
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:32,520
simply browsing it.

1684
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,580
So it's very interesting.

1685
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,940
It's a different type
of user experience.

1686
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:39,340
They also have social features,
they have featured

1687
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,970
links, you can discover what
your friends have been

1688
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,320
watching through connections
to social networks.

1689
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,690
And then the NowBox user
interface is also quite

1690
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:50,760
interesting.

1691
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,690
If any one of you has a cable
box, this might look a

1692
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:57,570
similar, because the programming
that you get from

1693
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:01,860
Now Box resembles kind of
the familiar layout.

1694
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:04,210
And based on your interest, they
actually build a complete

1695
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:08,640
programming guide for you, so
you can just sit back, relax,

1696
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,780
and watch the content that you
are already subscribed to, or

1697
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,030
content that they have
recommended.

1698
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,590

1699
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:17,190
All right.

1700
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:20,770
And now, we have run out of
time, but we've done it.

1701
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:24,625
So thank you very much, that's
[INAUDIBLE] demos.

1702
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:29,116
[APPLAUSE]

1703
01:26:29,116 --> 01:26:30,620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great,
thank you.

1704
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,890
And do we have one or two
questions about these YouTube

1705
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:37,440
APIs, or even any questions for
any of the presenters that

1706
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,280
have come up and demoed
with you?

1707
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:41,660
Yes.

1708
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,460
One second while I
run out to you.

1709
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,260
FEMALE SPEAKER: What inspired
y'all to do all this, because

1710
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,390
it's amazing.

1711
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:50,000
I mean, wow.

1712
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,100
Y'all should give yourselves a
round of applause as well.

1713
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:56,250

1714
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well I mean,
thank you very much.

1715
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:00,320
I think the credit goes to the
companies that presented.

1716
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,430
I mean, we rarely provide the
tools, but they're the ones

1717
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:03,700
that are innovating with it.

1718
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,570
So I would like to give a
round of applause to our

1719
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:07,280
presenters.

1720
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,620
[APPLAUSE]

1721
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Any
other questions?

1722
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,211
You got one more question.

1723
01:27:15,211 --> 01:27:18,120
Hold on, I'm going to
get by you here.

1724
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,510
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, cool.

1725
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,510
I love all the content
curation.

1726
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:26,030
I was wondering if they had a
quick second to talk about how

1727
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:28,780
their curation and their apps
maybe integrates with

1728
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,850
YouTube's already content
creation with like

1729
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:33,990
subscriptions and
stuff like that?

1730
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:34,380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

1731
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,670
So you can integrate
subscriptions

1732
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:38,500
programmatically.

1733
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,990
So if you subscribe to a
channel in an app, that

1734
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:43,630
subscription actually is
reflected in your YouTube

1735
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,960
subscriptions.

1736
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,770
As well as your actions, for
example liking a video, can

1737
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:50,380
also be integrated,
so it actually

1738
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,090
represents a like on YouTube.

1739
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:54,770
So the API allows you that.

1740
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We actually
have time for one more

1741
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,300
question if you have it.

1742
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,380
No?

1743
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:00,090
OK.

1744
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:03,260
Well then, let's go
right into Cloud

1745
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,950
Adventures, I like that title.

1746
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:06,710
We have Iein and Michael here.

1747
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:09,930
They're going to talk to you
about spending your time on

1748
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:14,370
building your app, not
the infrastructure.

1749
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:14,810
IEIN VALDEZ: Whoa.

1750
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:15,530
Hello.

1751
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,310
Hi, everyone.

1752
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:19,350
I'm Iein Valdez with our Cloud
Developer Relations Team and

1753
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,710
Michael, and we're here to talk
about cloud adventures.

1754
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:25,210
Does anyone here build
apps today?

1755
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:26,050
A few people build apps.

1756
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,420
Does anyone use the
cloud for apps?

1757
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:28,770
Couple people.

1758
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:29,610
All right, well this is great.

1759
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,030
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the cloud,

1760
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:32,890
why you should care about it.

1761
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,600
So the overview of the talk is
we're going to give a little

1762
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,740
bit of history about web
application development, some

1763
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:39,480
of the challenges like 10 years
ago, and where we are

1764
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,790
today with App Engine and some
of our other products, talk a

1765
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,420
little bit about some of the new
markets that are starting

1766
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,780
to take advantage
of the cloud.

1767
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,890
The web was sort of the primary
market, but now we're

1768
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:51,940
seeing mobile, gaming, and
big data start to be real

1769
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:53,600
industries that are taking
advantage of the cloud.

1770
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,480
And then Michael's going to
talk about big query, big

1771
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:57,680
data, and some of the things
we're doing there.

1772
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,650
So this is a picture of my life
about 10 years ago, when

1773
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,050
I was building web
applications.

1774
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:06,360
I basically had this very
complicated process of putting

1775
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,820
together this stack and figuring
out how to launch an

1776
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,110
application.

1777
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,960
It took really, really a lot
of time for me to manage

1778
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:12,610
everything.

1779
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:15,435
And then once I sort of figured
out the stack and I

1780
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:17,980
actually started to write the
application and we had users,

1781
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,770
we actually had to figure out
how to scale the application,

1782
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,900
make sure the application was
running, and people could

1783
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,870
actually get to our app.

1784
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:25,700
I spent a lot of time managing
machines, figuring out how to

1785
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,540
get a database working, backing
the database up,

1786
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,210
running the database, load.

1787
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:32,180
And then of course, the users,
which we were in the business

1788
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,950
of making our users happy, we
actually did not spend a lot

1789
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:35,230
of time on our users.

1790
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:37,300
We spent most of our time
managing our stack, and that

1791
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,460
was really sad.

1792
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,290
And things are very
different today.

1793
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:42,890
So just sort of recap some of
the problems when you're

1794
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,470
building large scale web apps.

1795
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:46,950
One is it's very difficult to
get up and running quickly,

1796
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,890
and it's very difficult to
iterate on your application

1797
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,390
and get it to the cloud.

1798
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,640
It used take three months to
get a stack ready, up and

1799
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,370
running, and pushing out builds
was like a weekly to

1800
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:57,370
monthly process.

1801
01:29:57,370 --> 01:29:59,060
Today, you can do that
very quickly.

1802
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,720
The infrastructure costs
were very painful.

1803
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,210
So managing the hardware,
data centers, bandwidth,

1804
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,100
multi-homing to make sure that
we were available if we one of

1805
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,590
our data centers caught
on fire, very painful.

1806
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:12,270
Back-ups, security upgrades, all
of this stuff we had to do

1807
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,800
to just to make sure our
app was running.

1808
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,730
And then databases were
super expensive.

1809
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:18,340
So there's kind of two parts
to app developers.

1810
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:20,300
There's one serving the request,
the other part is

1811
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,740
actually persisting the data,
making changes on your mutable

1812
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:24,840
data, and that was actually
really difficult.

1813
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,430
So these were lots and lots of
different problems, and this

1814
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:29,730
was sort of why App Engine
was created to

1815
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:30,840
simplify this process.

1816
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:34,100
And App Engine's philosophy is
to make it easy to build

1817
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,820
applications number one,
easy to get started.

1818
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:38,940
Easy to run and manage these
applications, so once you've

1819
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:41,530
got it built and pushed, you
want to make it really easy to

1820
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:43,950
kind of control it.

1821
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:45,970
And easy to scale, and this was
really the key thing was

1822
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:49,160
that all of that work on
infrastructure was just to

1823
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,370
solve the scale problem,
and so we

1824
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:52,050
packaged all that together.

1825
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:53,740
And the other philosophy we
have is it's free to get

1826
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,170
started and you pay
for what you use.

1827
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,580
So it's really easy to get your
app up and running, and

1828
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:01,070
it's not just for web serving
but also for data persistence.

1829
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:03,940
So today, App Engine runs on
three languages, we have

1830
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,860
Python, Java, and Go,
so it's pretty easy

1831
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,710
to get up and running.

1832
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:09,400
And I'm going to give you a
quick demo to actually show

1833
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,710
you what it's like, how fast
you can get an app

1834
01:31:11,710 --> 01:31:12,730
running in the cloud.

1835
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:15,100
So I'm on Mac OS and I have
the App Engine launched.

1836
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,960
You can go to
appengine.google.com, download

1837
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,130
this in a few minutes.

1838
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,790
It runs on Mac OS,
Linux, Windows.

1839
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:22,290
And I'm using the
Python version.

1840
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,230
We're just going to create
a quick app here.

1841
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:26,200
We're going to call
this Iein Demo.

1842
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,150
And the nice thing about this
is it gives you a little

1843
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:29,170
starter project.

1844
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:30,640
And this starter project
is basically your

1845
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,860
typical Hello World.

1846
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:34,680
There's a few files for
configuration, but the main

1847
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,480
application here really
is this Hello World.

1848
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,350
So let's just say, Hello SXSW.

1849
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:44,390
And I'm able to then run my
application on my machine in a

1850
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:46,540
disconnected state and
test and build it.

1851
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,120
So here's my application.

1852
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,870
Pretty easy, it's running
locally on my machine, I can

1853
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:51,060
make changes and iterate.

1854
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:53,450
But now, let's see what it takes
to get this application

1855
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,360
into the cloud up and running.

1856
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,920
So we go back to our App Engine
Launcher, and we can

1857
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,400
click Deploy.

1858
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,400
And what this is basically
going to do is take my

1859
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,010
application, package up the
files, and push it up to

1860
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:04,700
Google's cloud.

1861
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:09,020
So I've got my dashboard here,
and let's take a look here.

1862
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,990
IeinDemoAppSpot.com, and there's
my application up and

1863
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,700
running in the cloud.

1864
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,420
So in literally a matter of
seconds, you can take your

1865
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:18,540
application, your code on your
laptop, package it and have it

1866
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:21,530
running in the cloud, and have
millions of users hitting your

1867
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:22,090
application.

1868
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:24,580
So that is super, super easy.

1869
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:25,880
So that's a quick demo.

1870
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,690
Let's talk about some of the
core features of App Engine.

1871
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:30,340
So in terms of serving web
requests, we have sort of a

1872
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,120
few core features.

1873
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,420
We have front ends for short
bursty requests, we have back

1874
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,590
end for long, long-limbed
requests, or maybe you want to

1875
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:38,410
run code in the background
a lot.

1876
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,920
Task Queues, to be able to queue
up work, and we Cron for

1877
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:41,760
scheduling.

1878
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,720
So there's some nice
features built in.

1879
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,320
From the storage layer, we
have a couple different

1880
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:46,820
technologies.

1881
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:51,410
We have our Data Store, which
is really our key values

1882
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:52,930
store, basically in the
cloud, very scalable.

1883
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:56,000
We have CloudSQL, which is a
MySQL in the cloud, as well as

1884
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,430
a high performance Memcache
layer to really aid

1885
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:00,070
performance.

1886
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:02,230
Services we have a number of
really powerful services.

1887
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:05,960
We have Users API, Mail API,
Image, URL Fetch, MapReduce, a

1888
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,750
really cool one called
TrafficSplitting, which

1889
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,300
actually lets you deploy
multiple versions of your

1890
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:13,610
applications and do AB testing
really simply.

1891
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,300
So the key thing here is that
all of these services, from

1892
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:21,340
the compute, storage, and users,
mail, et cetera, these

1893
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,770
are all managed for you.

1894
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,470
These are building blocks that
just run as a service.

1895
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:26,580
You don't have to configure and
install software to make

1896
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,030
these things work.

1897
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:30,190
So let's talk a little bit about
where we are today in

1898
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:30,650
the market.

1899
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:33,290
So App Engine today serves over
five billion daily hits.

1900
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:35,430
We have over a million
applications running on the

1901
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:38,590
platform, and 150,000 active
developers building.

1902
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,430
And you can see when we started
out in 2008, the

1903
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:42,860
trajectory of this has just
been sort of going up over

1904
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:43,890
time as we've added features.

1905
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:47,320
So it's a platform that you can
launch your application

1906
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,310
and know that it's going to
be there and running.

1907
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:53,260
So I wanted to give a quick
example of what it was like to

1908
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,630
quickly launch and host and
run an app in the cloud.

1909
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:59,310
So hopefully everyone here
uses Google, and you know

1910
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,650
there's the turkey
doodle, right?

1911
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,010
And so this was actually an idea
of one of the engineers,

1912
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,390
he wanted to build this turkey
doodle and launch it very

1913
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,140
quickly, and he didn't really
know what tools to use.

1914
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:11,430
So he decided to try out App
Engine and Go, and put this

1915
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:12,260
turkey doodle together.

1916
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,320
And so he was able in 24 hours
to basically create this

1917
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:18,040
doodle, test it, and launch
it on the Google homepage.

1918
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,440
So this is kind of a
cool little doodle.

1919
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,770
It's an interactive doodle, you
can kind of click here and

1920
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,890
customize your turkey, and
there's a sort of a slot

1921
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:27,790
machine effect here so you
can get a random turkey.

1922
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:29,660
Doodle and then you can, of
course, link and share with

1923
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:30,060
your friends.

1924
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:33,520
So the point was, this engineer
was able to use the

1925
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,380
tools that are available to you,
build this doodle, and

1926
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,740
launch it to millions of users
in a day, and you have that

1927
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:42,180
same technology at your
disposal, which is very cool.

1928
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,495
So quickly, a couple
of other--

1929
01:34:44,495 --> 01:34:46,810
and just as we talked about,
web was really a primary

1930
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:48,370
driver, a great use case,
but now we have

1931
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:49,580
cloud-enabled mobile.

1932
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,660
So we have a massive number of
mobile devices coming online.

1933
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:53,740
Everyone has a smartphone in
their pocket, they're becoming

1934
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:55,390
internet-enabled, they're
generating

1935
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,040
lots and lots of traffic.

1936
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,560
Apps now share state, they're
no longer self-contained.

1937
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,480
So they're making API
calls to back ends

1938
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,410
and third party apps.

1939
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:04,680
They're social graph
enabled, right?

1940
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:07,960
You're pulling your friend
network in and so forth.

1941
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,890
And of course now, there's video
upload and download.

1942
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:11,720
So there's lots of information
being generated, you need to

1943
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,460
serve this traffic.

1944
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,770
How do you actually do that if
you're a mobile developer and

1945
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:16,580
you don't know anything about
serving infrastructure?

1946
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,750
So that's where you can use
something like App Engine.

1947
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:22,620
I wanted to give a quick story
about a great case for this,

1948
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:26,170
which is Outfit 7, they build
the Talking Tomcat apps, and a

1949
01:35:26,170 --> 01:35:27,980
bunch of apps you're probably
familiar with.

1950
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:31,550
It's interesting because they
have, I think, over 14

1951
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:32,510
applications launched.

1952
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:36,020
They now have over 350 million
downloads of their apps.

1953
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:39,410
Every day, over a million new
users on mobile devices are

1954
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:41,010
installing this application.

1955
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:43,080
And they're available in 120
different countries.

1956
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,940
So that is a massive
amount of scale.

1957
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,190
How do you actually
make your app run?

1958
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:49,940
And they use App Engine
as part of their

1959
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,430
infrastructure back end.

1960
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,080
Another great use case
is Pulse Mobile.

1961
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,140
So this is another example of a
mobile back end for Android,

1962
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,270
IOS, Kindle.

1963
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:59,860
Pulse is a news reading
application.

1964
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:02,430
They use the Python runtime,
they're serving thousands of

1965
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:05,410
queries per second, 100 million
daily requests coming

1966
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:08,580
out of the platform, and it's
very cost effective for them.

1967
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:12,050
So another example of a great
mobile use case to power your

1968
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:14,240
application.

1969
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,710
Another really interesting
market that's starting to take

1970
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:19,390
advantage of cloud as
well is gaming.

1971
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:21,570
So I was just at the GCC
conference, Game Developers'

1972
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,360
Conference, and it was really
fascinating to see all the

1973
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,530
developers out there, and cloud
was a really big topic.

1974
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,760
So there's this really
interesting shift of a new

1975
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,610
distribution model.

1976
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:31,080
Sort of the old world was the
day when you had game

1977
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,930
cartridges or DVDS or CDs, and
that's how you actually played

1978
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:36,390
games, you put these things in
your gaming console on your

1979
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:37,480
desktop and you ran it.

1980
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,060
And we're now transitioning to a
new world of gaming, I think

1981
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,180
partly to the desktop, which
is kind of fascinating.

1982
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:44,860
So Chrome has this thing called
Native Client where you

1983
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:48,540
can actually take your C, C++,
or any native code, run it

1984
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,500
through the Chrome Sandbox,
and actually deliver those

1985
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,640
games into the browser.

1986
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,740
Very, very fascinating.

1987
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:56,730
There's also HTML5 native games,
so you can run pretty

1988
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:58,570
powerful games in the
browser alone.

1989
01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:00,760
And then there's sort of all in
the cloud, meaning gaming

1990
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:01,880
is fully running in the cloud.

1991
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:03,970
A great company that's actually
doing this OnLive,

1992
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:05,830
and they're essentially running
the entire game on a

1993
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:08,540
server somewhere else, and
they're just shipping the bits

1994
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:11,020
over the wires, so you can just
play from any console.

1995
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,780
It's very, very, very cool.

1996
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,310
So how can App Engine help
you with gaming?

1997
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:16,240
Well, there's a couple
of things.

1998
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,770
All of these games of lots and
lots of static assets, so big

1999
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:21,340
files that need to be served.

2000
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:24,400
Data store for managing your
scores, games, leader boards,

2001
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:24,960
and so forth.

2002
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,730
So you need to be able
to have a scalable

2003
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,030
database to handle that.

2004
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:32,170
As well as for HTML5 games,
being able to serve up your

2005
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:34,860
web apps, HTML, JavaScript,
and so forth.

2006
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:37,260
So just a couple quick examples
of gamers that are

2007
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,080
taking advantage of this.

2008
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,360
Rovio built Angry Birds in
collaboration with us, and

2009
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,250
it's a fully native web game,
HTML5, it's using play and

2010
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:47,120
frame, our Google Web Toolkit,
Google+ integration, and App

2011
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,660
Engine actually serve and run
all of this in the cloud.

2012
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,360
So it's a great game,
check it out.

2013
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,920
Chrome.angrybirds.com.

2014
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,040
Another really good game in
the Chrome Web Store is

2015
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,650
FieldRunners, that's another
example of a game.

2016
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,200
So just to sum up, and I'm
going to hand it off to

2017
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,790
Michael here in a second.

2018
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:04,390
Think of using App Engine as,
it's a platform that's going

2019
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:06,640
to allow you to be nimble focus
on your application.

2020
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,780
It's perfect for web apps,
games, and mobiles.

2021
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:10,590
So a great use case is, if
you're building any of these

2022
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:13,310
things, really take a look at
the cloud and App Engine.

2023
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:15,460
Focus on your application and
not the infrastructure.

2024
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,400
Don't worry about managing.

2025
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,710
You're not going to be an
expert, just let us do the

2026
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,090
heavy lifting for you.

2027
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:22,340
And so running the app is
easy, but how do you

2028
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,280
fine tune it, right?

2029
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,440
There's all this data
being generated.

2030
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,370
Are your users happy?

2031
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:26,420
How can you take advantage
of this?

2032
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,360
How can you help make your
application better?

2033
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,000
And I think that's where all of
this massive amount of data

2034
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,080
that's being generated, you need
to sort of figure out how

2035
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,250
you can derive insight from
this before it's too late.

2036
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,200
And that's where sort of these
big data technologies are

2037
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,190
really starting to come into
play, and Michael's going to

2038
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:40,100
talk about big data.

2039
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,142
So thanks, guys.

2040
01:38:43,142 --> 01:38:44,486
[APPLAUSE]

2041
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:45,240
MICHAEL: Hey, everyone.

2042
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,350
Can you guys all hear me?

2043
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,550
Yeah?

2044
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,570
So yeah, thanks for
being here.

2045
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,090
My name is Michael, I
work with Iein on

2046
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,313
the Cloud Devel Team.

2047
01:38:51,313 --> 01:38:54,420
OK, So if you've read a tech
blog in the last three months,

2048
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:56,740
you've heard the term "big
data." it's a buzzword.

2049
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:58,200
It means two things when
it's a buzzword.

2050
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,370
One, nobody knows what
it is, and two,

2051
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:01,380
there's a lot of hype.

2052
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:04,240
But I think there's a lot of
validity in using big data

2053
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,120
analytics for all kinds of
applications, and I'm very

2054
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,260
passionate about this.

2055
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:10,970
The other cool thing about this
sort of like hype around

2056
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:13,300
big data is that there's a lot
of cool tools coming out,

2057
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,500
things that we couldn't even
have imagined two years ago.

2058
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,490
And I'm going to talk
about one of them

2059
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:18,450
today, Google Big Query.

2060
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:20,270
But if you're interested in
doing something with data

2061
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:21,930
analytics, I'm going to
tell you a story.

2062
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:23,800
You probably know the story if
you've already done this, and

2063
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,290
if you're thinking about getting
into it, you're going

2064
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,420
to learn this story.

2065
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,670
So let's start with
a single record.

2066
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:28,630
Here's a single record.

2067
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:30,390
It's easy to work with,
it fits on your local

2068
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:32,920
workstation, you can develop
with it without having to

2069
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,340
worry about extra hardware
or extra infrastructure.

2070
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,020
And your manager, and in fact,
this happened to me last week.

2071
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,900
My manager came up to me and
said, we need to build a data

2072
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,920
visualization app based on some
of the data you have. And

2073
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,960
I said great, simple.

2074
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:45,870
No problem, right?

2075
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,210
You just build it.

2076
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:49,320
You can use the same kind of web
stack you're normally used

2077
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,150
to, same tools on your
workstation, you're fine.

2078
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:53,710
Well, it's a hit.

2079
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:55,480
Now you're a mobile gamer, and
you decide, well, I want to

2080
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:59,180
build a crowd-sourced app that
shows you which buildings are

2081
01:39:59,180 --> 01:40:01,960
best suited for defending
against zombie attacks or

2082
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:02,670
something, right?

2083
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:05,260
So you're using crowd-sourced
data, a lot of data, now you

2084
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:06,140
have a million records.

2085
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:06,640
No, wait.

2086
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:08,450
Now you really have a million
records, right?

2087
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,510
You have a lot of data.

2088
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:10,730
Now, this is still OK.

2089
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:12,740
You could probably handle this
on the normal application

2090
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:15,510
stack that you have, some of
the software that you're

2091
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:16,450
using, you're used to.

2092
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:19,070
But there's going to be a point
where those tools may

2093
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:21,570
not work, and that's when you
get something like a billion,

2094
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:22,880
and now you've got a
big data problem.

2095
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,060
So what are some of the things
that you might have to do when

2096
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,220
you get to billions of records,

2097
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:27,950
gigabytes of gigabytes.

2098
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:30,450
Well, maybe you shard your
traditional MySQL database.

2099
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:33,590
Maybe you buy new software,
you're switching from one

2100
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:36,250
stack to another, you're going
from a relational model to a

2101
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,780
no SQL model.

2102
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:39,700
Or maybe you're preprocessing
data for analytics.

2103
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:43,270
So you're running your
traditional MySQL database

2104
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:46,090
overnight to get some
kind of results.

2105
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:47,570
And then maybe you need
more employee time or

2106
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:49,350
you need more employees.

2107
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:50,750
And that's when things
get a little crazy.

2108
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,410
Then your database starts
looking like the Borg

2109
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,450
spaceship and you've got
terabytes of data, and then

2110
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:56,160
you're in real trouble, because
then maybe you have to

2111
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,110
rethink your whole system.

2112
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:00,430
So let me tell you about
scale, right?

2113
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:03,090
So as you move from paradigm
to paradigm, what happens?

2114
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:07,190
Well, you can maybe predict the
cost of new storage, or

2115
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:09,660
instances, or virtual machines,
there may be a fixed

2116
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:10,660
cost there.

2117
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,850
But moving from gigabytes to
terabytes, moving from

2118
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,420
paradigm to paradigm,
I don't know.

2119
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:15,240
You don't know what it costs.

2120
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,040
It's hard to predict.

2121
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,820
And new expertise, new
employees, these are things

2122
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,230
that are hard to predict.

2123
01:41:20,230 --> 01:41:23,150
So the total cost of
your scale-up,

2124
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:24,860
you don't know, right?

2125
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:28,180
And so when you don't know,
you're not in the application

2126
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:28,800
business anymore.

2127
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,260
You're in the infrastructure
business.

2128
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:31,600
And you're an application
developer.

2129
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,830
You're making a game, you're
making a crowd-sourced mobile

2130
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:35,280
app, something like that.

2131
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,540
So you don't want to be in the
infrastructure business.

2132
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,410
Google's been down this
road too, right?

2133
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:41,960
When we were called BackRub and
we were just a glimmer in

2134
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:45,590
a Stanford graduate student's
eye, we had 26 million pages

2135
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:46,400
in our index, right?

2136
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,550
And then two years later,
we had a billion.

2137
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,720
So our data just scaled
enormously and we had to come

2138
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,176
up with new tools
to handle this.

2139
01:41:52,176 --> 01:41:54,420
And then it quadrupled in the
next couple years, and then we

2140
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,800
added an Image index.

2141
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,830
And then by, let's see, 2008,
it hit a trillion, right?

2142
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,150
So we've been down this road.

2143
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:02,470
And now it's 2012, I think
we're at a gazillion.

2144
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:04,940
I don't know what the number
is, some huge number.

2145
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:06,410
So that brings to
Google BigQuery.

2146
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:08,530
OK, so what is Google
BigQuery?

2147
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:11,170
Google BigQuery is our
tool for analyzing

2148
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,330
massive data sets.

2149
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:15,040
It uses a SQL-style language
that you may already be used

2150
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,570
to, makes it easy to write
queries on this data.

2151
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:20,910
But the best part about it, as
a developer the thing I love

2152
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:23,160
is it's an API, it's
a service.

2153
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:26,130
You make calls to it via API,
you can use the programming

2154
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:28,890
language of your choice,
it's a RESTful API.

2155
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:30,350
So we use this technology
internally.

2156
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:31,770
We've written a few
papers about it.

2157
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:33,950
Internally, we call it Dremel,
and you can read the paper,

2158
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:35,260
the research paper we
published, if you're

2159
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:36,075
interested.

2160
01:42:36,075 --> 01:42:38,080
Without getting too technical,
I know this is a lightning

2161
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,910
talk, I don't have a lot of
time, but it's really great

2162
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:40,320
information.

2163
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:43,170
We basically store the data in
a colander format, and it

2164
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:47,800
helps us retrieve these kind
of queries quickly.

2165
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,250
And so I'll show you a demo
in just a second.

2166
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,530
One thing I want to tell you is
the way you use it is that

2167
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:54,970
you take your data in CSV format
and you send it to

2168
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:55,940
Google's cloud.

2169
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:59,290
Once in there, you can ingest it
into the BigQuery data set,

2170
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,790
and then it allows you to
run queries via API.

2171
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:05,870
So since this is an API, we're
able to actually build a

2172
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:06,750
browser client.

2173
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,550
So when you sign up for
BigQuery, you have access to a

2174
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:10,630
web browser tool, and that's
actually built

2175
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:11,430
on top of the API.

2176
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:13,590
So it's kind of like a way for
us to dog food our own

2177
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:15,360
technology, so I'll show
you an example.

2178
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,590
So here's this BigQuery
window.

2179
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,200
This is a tool that let's
you browse queries.

2180
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,100
You can see, I've been playing
with us today, there's a lot

2181
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:20,890
of queries.

2182
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:22,500
I'm going to show you how
fast this thing is.

2183
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,020
This is pretty remarkable.

2184
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:25,750
We couldn't do a lot of the
things at Google without the

2185
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:29,180
speed that this technology
allows us to run queries with.

2186
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:31,810
The first thing I'm going to
show you is a data set of all

2187
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:35,330
the revision history of
Wikipedia up until about 2010,

2188
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,200
which is a lot of data.

2189
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:40,640
So let's count the records in
this data set, and I'll give

2190
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:43,880
you a sense of how fast
this tool is.

2191
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,080
So right now I'm running--

2192
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,350
two seconds.

2193
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,190
In two seconds, we return
the result.

2194
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:52,062
I don't know if you can see it,
make it a little bigger.

2195
01:43:52,062 --> 01:43:54,290
330 million records
in that data.

2196
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:56,020
So in two seconds, we
retrieved a count.

2197
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:59,340
Now, the fun thing to do with
this data set is to see what

2198
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:01,640
were the most revised
articles, right?

2199
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,420
Which articles got the
most attention?

2200
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:06,000
So let's do this query,
this will tell us.

2201
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,890
Let's run that and see
how long this takes.

2202
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:09,190
The most revised.

2203
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:11,140
Try to think about it before--
it's already done.

2204
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,020
George W. Bush.

2205
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:14,060
And I'm always fascinated by
this, followed by World

2206
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:17,350
Wrestling Entertainment
employees pages.

2207
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:20,460
I think I know why George W.
Bush might be revised a lot.

2208
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:21,870
I wasn't sure about the
World Wrestling thing.

2209
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:23,410
I think it's because there's a
lot of fanboys and they like

2210
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:25,910
to add new stuff, the plot
lines are going on.

2211
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:28,760
So I was looking at this data
set and I thought, you know, I

2212
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,330
want to know why these
things are revised.

2213
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:33,160
So I started looking at the
George W. Bush article, and I

2214
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:36,200
realized that when people revert
due to vandalism, they

2215
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,630
have a comment in the
revision history,

2216
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:38,690
reverted due to vandalism.

2217
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:42,190
So I wanted to see how many
articles were reverted due to

2218
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,720
vandalism or contained vandalism
in the comments?

2219
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,160
And what's fun about BigQuery is
it's so blazingly fast, you

2220
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,190
can run these ad hoc queries
over and over.

2221
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:50,620
So let's see if I can
find that one.

2222
01:44:50,620 --> 01:44:52,970
Sorry, I have to
zoom out a bit.

2223
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:54,670
Oh yeah, here we go.

2224
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:58,620
So let's see, vandalism in the
Revision History comments.

2225
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,672
The answer may surprise you.

2226
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,090
Ah, five seconds, right?

2227
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:06,960
So we went through 100 million
rows in five seconds.

2228
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,740
Yes, George Bush, a lot of
comments about vandalism, and

2229
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,270
then Wikipedia itself, and
then Neopets, right?

2230
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:14,326
And so I gave this talk at
another place and I said, you

2231
01:45:14,326 --> 01:45:15,845
know, I would probably
vandalize the Neopets

2232
01:45:15,845 --> 01:45:17,120
Wikipedia article.

2233
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,880
And then Led Zeppelin, the
controversial band Led

2234
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,100
Zeppelin, and then
Adolf Hitler.

2235
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:23,580
So this is great, right?

2236
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:25,940
This just shows you the power of
being able to query across

2237
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,950
these massive data sets.

2238
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:28,760
So I'm interested
in Wikipedia.

2239
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,300
One of my coworkers at Google
gave me access to a Wikipedia

2240
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:33,730
data dump of the actual text.

2241
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:34,900
This is just the revision
history.

2242
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,530
That's a very enormous set.

2243
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:39,450
And I'm interested in bias, bias
language, because that's

2244
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:41,280
something I'm interested
in studying.

2245
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:44,090
So I tried to write
this web app.

2246
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:44,840
Let's see if this
thing will work.

2247
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,090
This is the Wikipedia
Weasel text finder.

2248
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:51,160
So Weasel Words in Wikipedia
are words that have bias

2249
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,500
language or bias
phrases, right?

2250
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,650

2251
01:45:57,650 --> 01:46:01,060
So language like, "without a
doubt" or, "it should be

2252
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:04,100
noted." So the Wikipedia editors
consider this language

2253
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,590
to be indicative of bias.

2254
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:08,030
So I wanted to see, what
articles contain

2255
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:08,480
some of this language?

2256
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:13,040
So I wrote this app that
actually scans the Wikipedia

2257
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:16,150
text and in seconds, returns
articles that contain some of

2258
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:16,870
this information.

2259
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,140
So here's "many are of the
opinion." Now let's just pick

2260
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,640
a random one like Menahem
the Essene.

2261
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,610
Now if you go to this site, and
you can't really see it

2262
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,960
well, but it looks like somebody
has already tagged

2263
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,720
this as a Weasel Word, or maybe
this is an automated

2264
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,170
process, I don't
actually know.

2265
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:30,030
It's a Weasel Word.

2266
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:31,630
So "many are of the opinion,"
bias language.

2267
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:34,250
So I wanted to go back and see,
well, what about articles

2268
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,200
with "it should be noted,"
or "without a doubt?"

2269
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,510
Let's take a look.

2270
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:39,640
And I'm scanning the
entire Wikipedia

2271
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,650
corpus in seconds, right?

2272
01:46:41,650 --> 01:46:42,770
So here we go.

2273
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:45,170
Here's a random sampling of
articles that contain this

2274
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:47,350
bias language.

2275
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:49,810
Here's one, "it should be
noted." So I don't know what

2276
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:53,500
this airport is, but it should
be noted, and it's not marked

2277
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:53,960
as Weasel Text.

2278
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:55,560
So imagine what you could
do with this tool.

2279
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,990
You could do a daily scan and
look for biased language in

2280
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:58,890
seconds, right?

2281
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:00,480
And you don't have to worry
about the kind of crunching

2282
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,980
away, buying new servers,
et cetera, et cetera.

2283
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:08,120
It's all in API, and
it's very fast.

2284
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:11,440
So let's just recap this.

2285
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,550
So I wanted to get two
points across to you.

2286
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:15,475
One, your data analysis need
should scale with your data.

2287
01:47:15,475 --> 01:47:17,090
You shouldn't hop from paradigm
to paradigm to

2288
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:20,290
paradigm if you know you're
going to scale up.

2289
01:47:20,290 --> 01:47:21,810
Your cost and technology
should be predictable.

2290
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:22,920
That's the thing a lot of people
forget when they're

2291
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:25,580
doing big data is they go from
software to software, and it's

2292
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:27,550
great, and then they forget
about the cost of switching,

2293
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:29,950
the cost of maintaining,
the cost of hardware.

2294
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:32,450
And finally, don't build
infrastructure.

2295
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:33,060
Build your app.

2296
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,250
You're app developers, right?

2297
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:36,990
So you can use this tool to
build cool mobile games,

2298
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:39,400
crowd-sourced tools,
visualizations, dashboards.

2299
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,440
We have people using it to
build game analytics

2300
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,550
technology, we have people doing
things like with hotel

2301
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:48,050
and hospitality industry, just
amazing amounts of data, and

2302
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:50,030
being able to do real time
dashboards with this tool.

2303
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:51,780
It's great.

2304
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:53,050
So that's all I have for this.

2305
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,500
I'm going to leave
this up here.

2306
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,470
This presentation that I made is
actually in App Engine now,

2307
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:00,470
and if you want to learn more,
AppEngine.google.com is where

2308
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:03,710
you can go for App Engine, and
developers.google.com/bigquery,

2309
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:05,370
and that's how you can
get ah old of us.

2310
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:09,800
And I think we have just enough
time for questions.

2311
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes, questions
about the cloud.

2312
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:14,360
We do actually have
some time for a

2313
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,610
fair number of questions.

2314
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:19,250

2315
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:19,960
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sorry
if I came in a

2316
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,460
little late for this.

2317
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,430
What's the pricing
model for the--

2318
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:24,940
MICHAEL: Are you talking about
the BigQuery pricing model?

2319
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:26,430
MALE SPEAKER: The BigQuery.

2320
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:28,210
MICHAEL: So this actually,
we're still in limited

2321
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:30,070
preview, and we haven't
launched an official

2322
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:31,460
pricing model yet.

2323
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:33,930
The one thing I can say is, the
cost of storing the data

2324
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:36,610
is very similar to Google Cloud
Storage, it's a very

2325
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:39,820
similar pricing model to that.

2326
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:42,085
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More questions
from the live audience?

2327
01:48:42,085 --> 01:48:46,200

2328
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,140
No questions?

2329
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:48,070
All right.

2330
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:49,380
Oh wait, we got someone.

2331
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,380
Last minute questions.

2332
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:54,670
MALE SPEAKER: When do you expect
the big data stuff to

2333
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:55,400
be launched?

2334
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,400
MICHAEL: This particular
product is

2335
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,720
very soon, very soon.

2336
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:01,516
Like maybe a month,
a month or two.

2337
01:49:01,516 --> 01:49:03,940
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, I know a lot
of times, the first time

2338
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:06,750
you run a query it's slow, and
then later on, SQL cache

2339
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,570
catches up and it
becomes faster.

2340
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:11,170
Does that happen here, do
queries get faster the more

2341
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:12,930
you run them, or
what kind of--?

2342
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:14,790
MICHAEL: We don't have any
caching on the server.

2343
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:17,060
You can do your own caching, and
that's a strategy a lot of

2344
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,130
people use, but we
don't do any.

2345
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:22,560

2346
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,960
Anything else?

2347
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,800
I will say one last thing.

2348
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,650
If you're interested in using
BigQuery, you can sign up for

2349
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:29,560
the limited preview and use it
before we do the general.

2350
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:32,260

2351
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:32,785
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More
questions.

2352
01:49:32,785 --> 01:49:37,020
Ooh, questions beget
questions.

2353
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:38,970
MALE SPEAKER: So is this useful
both with structured

2354
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:40,460
data and unstructured data?

2355
01:49:40,460 --> 01:49:42,450
MICHAEL: So this is for what we
call semi-structured data,

2356
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:43,660
it's basically structured
data.

2357
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:45,570
We support a limited amount
of data types.

2358
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:46,340
MALE SPEAKER: What about
like [INAUDIBLE]

2359
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,170
search and those things?

2360
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:50,120
MICHAEL: That's maybe
an App Engine thing?

2361
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:52,330
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we can do
that with App Engine, so you

2362
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:55,370
can put your data into the data
source, SQL, [INAUDIBLE].

2363
01:49:55,370 --> 01:50:02,890

2364
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Any more
last minute questions?

2365
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:09,510
Going once, going twice,
going one to 100 times.

2366
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,370
All right, thank you.

2367
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:19,290
[APPLAUSE]

2368
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:21,990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --around
with HTML5 a lot.

2369
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:24,140
Paul is here to talk to
you about just that.

2370
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:29,585

2371
01:50:29,585 --> 01:50:31,320
PAUL IRISH: I think we have like
a bunch of seats up here

2372
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,710
if you want to fill in.

2373
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:35,090
Make sure it's not [INAUDIBLE]
crowded back there.

2374
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:41,760

2375
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,330
One, two, three, four.

2376
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:48,300

2377
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:49,550
Beautiful.

2378
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:57,250

2379
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:59,542
All right.

2380
01:50:59,542 --> 01:51:02,040
OK, I guess we'll get started.

2381
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:02,760
My name is Paul.

2382
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,720
I work on the Chrome Team doing
developer relations.

2383
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:09,240
And so I like to talk a lot
about how to build web apps

2384
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,654
and what are the new things
inside the browser that you

2385
01:51:11,654 --> 01:51:12,900
get to play with.

2386
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:16,705
This talk in particular, we're
going to talk about the new,

2387
01:51:16,705 --> 01:51:20,300
new new, hot stuff, and some of
the cool features that you

2388
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:24,180
have. So these sort of things
are available in Chrome

2389
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:27,560
Canary, so Chrome Canary's a
daily build, you get an update

2390
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,760
about once a day.

2391
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:32,900
So it's all live, fresh new
stuff, not too many bugs, it's

2392
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,380
pretty solid.

2393
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:37,740
I like to run it side
by side with Sable.

2394
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:41,040
But a lot of these are also in
other browsers too, like a

2395
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,830
Firefox Nightly and
Upper Next.

2396
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:46,220
So this is what we're going
to talk about today.

2397
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:49,710
Firstly, we're going to stop
with some CSS, kind of what we

2398
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:50,505
have as far as styling.

2399
01:51:50,505 --> 01:51:53,640
We'll get into some APIs that
are appropriate for games.

2400
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,920
Then we're going to talk about
being a nice person to users,

2401
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,880
and like saving their battery.

2402
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,530
I'm plugged in, but my battery
dies all the time, so we're

2403
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:07,320
talking about how to be very
conscientious about that,

2404
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,650
which I think is a good thing.

2405
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:12,000
And then I'm going to round up
with some real time voice and

2406
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,240
video stuff that I'm really
quite excited about.

2407
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:16,740
All right.

2408
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:18,490
We're going to kick off, get
right into it, we're going to

2409
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,740
talk about CSS Regions.

2410
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:22,350

2411
01:52:22,350 --> 01:52:25,600
So CSS Regions is a really
powerful thing, and a lot of

2412
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,360
this work actually
came from Adobe.

2413
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:32,085
So here we have a layout with
just some Lorem Ipsum.

2414
01:52:32,085 --> 01:52:35,720
But you see we have a column
here, the text goes over to

2415
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:39,410
here, and we have kind of this
area down here with a picture,

2416
01:52:39,410 --> 01:52:39,940
and then again

2417
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:42,330
two columns down there.

2418
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:45,660
So semi-complicated layout,
not too bad.

2419
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:48,730
But we're using regions.

2420
01:52:48,730 --> 01:52:52,490
And so what that means is that
we've defined these regions.

2421
01:52:52,490 --> 01:52:56,260
I'm going to zoom out
once more up here.

2422
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:57,030
OK, cool.

2423
01:52:57,030 --> 01:53:02,520
So I'm defining my boxes and
the geometry of my page.

2424
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:06,440
And then I have my content,
which actually has all the

2425
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,910
paragraph text.

2426
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:10,200
So that means that the paragraph
text is just kind of

2427
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,310
filling from box to box.

2428
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:15,130
And so I'm going to add Content
Editable, I'm just

2429
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:18,420
using the Chrome Dev tools and
adding Content Editable.

2430
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:20,950
This allows me to
edit this text.

2431
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:26,320
And so I could add in some
Chrome hearts HTML5,

2432
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:29,070
something like that.

2433
01:53:29,070 --> 01:53:30,990
And maybe I'll just
paste it a bunch.

2434
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:34,500
So you can see it's actually
pushing the text down into the

2435
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,890
next column.

2436
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:40,120
So this text is flowing from one
to the next to the next.

2437
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,710
So I'm really excited about
this because it basically

2438
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:45,670
allows for magazine
style layout.

2439
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:48,480
Layout's always been a
challenge, but Regions gives

2440
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:49,920
us a lot of power.

2441
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:54,570
This right here is a prototype
browser build from Adobe, and

2442
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:56,960
I'll show a few demos
from this one.

2443
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,510
So this is similar to
the last one, I just

2444
01:53:58,510 --> 01:53:59,950
have these three boxes.

2445
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:03,210
I'm going to resize it, and
you'll see the text is flowing

2446
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:05,580
from one to the next to
the next, just kind of

2447
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:06,830
filling up the space.

2448
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:09,500

2449
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,935
This is all just purely
defined in CSS.

2450
01:54:11,935 --> 01:54:14,560

2451
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:19,600
In addition to Regions, the spec
also captures exclusions.

2452
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:24,310
So this is, I want a circle
and a heart, and I want my

2453
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:27,510
text to work around that, so
I've defined my shapes.

2454
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:30,780
This is also completely dynamic,
so I could just

2455
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:31,450
define this.

2456
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:33,910
The text is just working its
way right around that.

2457
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:36,590
This is the Debug View, kind
of what I see what the

2458
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:39,620
actual shape is.

2459
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:41,850
And then I've got two more
for you on this one.

2460
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:44,460

2461
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,290
Again, magazine style layout,
really gorgeous.

2462
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:50,730
So we can just work against this
shape, even add in a bit

2463
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:57,930
of just kind of tweaking that,
and I like this one a lot.

2464
01:54:57,930 --> 01:54:59,620
So here we have, let's
see, I'm going to

2465
01:54:59,620 --> 01:55:05,290
turn this off, yes?

2466
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:06,890
OK, cool.

2467
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:09,900
So what I have on the bottom is
actually the debugger you

2468
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:14,550
turned on, so I do the shape
of my exclusion.

2469
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:19,260
And so as I slide this, the
car enters, the mountain

2470
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:22,530
shifts, and we're also seeing
all the text kind of just work

2471
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:24,340
its way around it.

2472
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,390
So this is a really
exciting stuff.

2473
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:29,930
Adobe and WebKit are working
together on this, and it's

2474
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:33,320
available now in
Chrome Canary.

2475
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:38,000
You just have to go into About
Flags, where a lot

2476
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,960
of this stuff is.

2477
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,660
And inside About Flags, you'll
find a lot of interesting

2478
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:45,350
experiments, and Regions is one
of the ones that we'll be

2479
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:49,830
covering today, but a bunch
more stuff is in here.

2480
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,570
All right, filters.

2481
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:54,200
Now, SVG, if you've done SVG
work, they've had filters for

2482
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,150
a long time, and we haven't
had them in CSS.

2483
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:03,070
But you've probably wanted to
blur or something, or like

2484
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:06,580
desaturate just a section
of the page.

2485
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:10,090
Filters brings that,
and we have it now.

2486
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:12,886
So I'll bring up this demo.

2487
01:56:12,886 --> 01:56:15,010
A nice little seascape,
let's see.

2488
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:16,875
I'm not going to use
that picture.

2489
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:18,610
We'll try that again.

2490
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:21,090
That's pretty good.

2491
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:27,080
So I have here, this is like an
image element, and I'll add

2492
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:27,740
some contract.

2493
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:30,705
So this is just the CSS line
that's making that change.

2494
01:56:30,705 --> 01:56:33,330

2495
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:37,990
There's Drop Shadow in filters,
I can desaturate it,

2496
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:40,490
or of course, we can blur it.

2497
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:43,850
Now, I'm applying this just to
an image element here, but

2498
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:44,950
this could be anything.

2499
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:47,410
This could be a video element,
this could be a paragraph of

2500
01:56:47,410 --> 01:56:49,450
text, this could be--

2501
01:56:49,450 --> 01:56:52,820
you've seen in other cases where
like a modal pop-up will

2502
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:55,010
come out, and then the entire
background will be like

2503
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:56,750
semi-blurred, like I think
this is a common

2504
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:58,830
technique in Flex.

2505
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:00,850
You can do that, no problem.

2506
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:03,640
And this works just like
any other CSS property.

2507
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:08,850
So I can use a CSS Key Frame
animation, make your audience

2508
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:11,870
sick, I'm sorry about that.

2509
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:14,400
But there's a lot of power, and
this is baked right into

2510
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,650
the platform.

2511
01:57:15,650 --> 01:57:18,200

2512
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,630
Good, cool.

2513
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:22,520
I want to give a shout out
to navigator.connection.

2514
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,670
So this is an API where a lot
of times, you'll be building

2515
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:28,650
like a mobile app and you want
to know, it would be really

2516
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:30,470
handy if you knew exactly
what sort of connection

2517
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:31,800
your user was on.

2518
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:34,470
You're going to send out high
resolution imagery if you know

2519
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:35,440
they're on a fast connection.

2520
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,010
Otherwise, you're going to tone
it down a notch, maybe

2521
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:40,990
not even send any images at all,
maybe just small sizes.

2522
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:44,770
So Navigator.connection type has
been available on Android

2523
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:47,310
for a while, it's not
in IOS as of yet.

2524
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:49,340
They're still actually working
out maybe a potential

2525
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:53,180
improvement to the spec, but
this allows you to have that

2526
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:56,150
sort of control and act
upon the network

2527
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,910
layer inside the browser.

2528
01:57:57,910 --> 01:58:00,950

2529
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:06,110
So on YouTube in a little Embed,
you can click the Full

2530
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:08,620
Screen and it goes full screen,
but there's been no

2531
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:11,560
way to do that outside
of Flash or other

2532
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,740
plug-in content so far.

2533
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:16,250
So now we have a Full
Screen API.

2534
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:20,890
This is implemented across
modern browsers these days.

2535
01:58:20,890 --> 01:58:23,830
So if we have let's say this
video element, we're going to

2536
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:27,180
set up a little on-click
element, and this is the main

2537
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:30,680
call right here, Request
Full Screen.

2538
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:35,630
And this is just going to say,
I'd like to take this element

2539
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:38,720
and go full screen with it.

2540
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:42,040
So again, the beauty here is
that it doesn't just work on

2541
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,780
videos or images, it
could work on an

2542
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,240
entire section of Dom.

2543
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,960
So I'll take this video and
I'll start playing it.

2544
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:53,490
And so this is just like a Div
of sorts, and I'll just toggle

2545
01:58:53,490 --> 01:58:56,280
Full Screen.

2546
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:58,420
And so we just take that entire
Div, we go full screen

2547
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:01,460
with it, we get that little
notification pop-up.

2548
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,950
And this is similar to the
presentation mode, if you've

2549
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:08,090
ever done manually Full Screen
in Chrome, it's just that, but

2550
01:59:08,090 --> 01:59:10,110
we've now triggered it
with JavaScript.

2551
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:13,330
So we can give our users this
option inside the app, instead

2552
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:18,200
of asking someone to actually
go up here and hit that.

2553
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:25,590
And the cool thing here is that
we also know if the user

2554
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:27,760
is viewing inside Full
Screen, and we can

2555
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,500
have contextual styling.

2556
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:33,250
So this right here,
this is an iFrame.

2557
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,920
And when I take this full
screen, I can actually detect

2558
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,860
that it's now being shown in
that Full Screen mode, and I

2559
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:40,280
can restyle it.

2560
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:45,460
So here, it's a lame iFrame, but
when we go full screen, we

2561
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:47,930
kind of crank it up a notch.

2562
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:48,500
Pretty good.

2563
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:52,260
I mean, it's kind of
ugly actually, but

2564
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:53,470
you have the option.

2565
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:56,500
OK, cool.

2566
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,710
Pointer Lock API is another API
that is really exciting,

2567
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:01,200
especially when it comes
to browser-based games.

2568
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,930

2569
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:05,740
I guess quickly, let's
say you're on a

2570
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:07,660
multi-monitor system.

2571
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:10,980
And if you want to run a game,
you're going to want to run it

2572
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:13,190
full screen, like a first
person shooter.

2573
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:15,640
And when you bring your cursor
to the edge because you like

2574
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:19,210
looking left or looking right,
you don't want your cursor to

2575
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:21,260
go on to the next monitor,
you want it to be

2576
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:22,770
stuck there, right?

2577
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:25,970
So the Pointer Lock API allows
you to kind of define, this is

2578
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:27,790
the area in which
I'm operating.

2579
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:30,270
So first, you take
it full screen.

2580
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:35,040
And then now, my cursor
is totally hidden.

2581
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,980
So the game can define its own
cursor if it wants, but you're

2582
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:41,180
probably just going to use
this for movement.

2583
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:45,210
And you can react, and you're
kind of stuck in full screen

2584
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:48,250
until you want to get out of it,
which is the behavior that

2585
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,770
you want when you're
building a game.

2586
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:54,370
So this was another
partnership.

2587
02:00:54,370 --> 02:00:56,410
Some Google engineers got
together with some Mozilla

2588
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:59,420
engineers, banged this spec out
in like the course of two

2589
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:02,340
months, and it's implemented
across both now.

2590
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:06,610
Another one that a gaming
community group got together

2591
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:12,050
on was the Gamepad API, and I'll
just show this demo here.

2592
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:17,870
So we're going to show this with
Firefox Nightly, but this

2593
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:20,470
is available in Chrome
as well.

2594
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:26,960
So we have, this is just a 2D
canvas game, and we're using

2595
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:31,890
an Xbox USB controller, just
plugs right into the machine.

2596
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:36,350
And essentially, Gamepad API
can track any sort of

2597
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:37,430
adjustments to that control.

2598
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:39,870
So whether it's like a joystick
with a lot of

2599
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:46,530
precision, or just up/down or
x, y, a, b, triggers, all

2600
02:01:46,530 --> 02:01:50,400
those buttons are covered by
the Gamepad API so you can

2601
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:56,790
enable a more rich input
method into your games.

2602
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:58,160
All right.

2603
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,035
Pause that and go forward.

2604
02:02:00,035 --> 02:02:03,660

2605
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:07,035
Like I said, I think it's
important to be nice, and one

2606
02:02:07,035 --> 02:02:10,770
of the things being nice is
recognizing kind of the

2607
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:14,200
context in which your users are
looking at your content.

2608
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:17,810
Page Visibility API
lets you do that.

2609
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:21,920
And so Page Visibility API
basically says, is the user

2610
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,690
looking at this page?

2611
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:32,040
So I'll show the demo first.
So cute little guy, HTML5

2612
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,882
video, it's cool.

2613
02:02:33,882 --> 02:02:37,020
If you see at the very top where
we just wired it up so

2614
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:39,490
that we count how many seconds
are passing by.

2615
02:02:39,490 --> 02:02:44,640
But if I switch tabs, now
it's immediately paused.

2616
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,560
I go back, it continues.

2617
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:50,990
So we're able to respond to
the fact that we know, the

2618
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:55,820
user is not looking here, we
can change the behavior and

2619
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:56,400
change the status.

2620
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:00,790
I think if you're writing
an IM client, user is

2621
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:02,650
idle, user is active.

2622
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:06,130
User is idle, user is active,
or something.

2623
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:10,260
You might also like, if you were
pulling the server for

2624
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,360
new messages or something,
you're probably going to

2625
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,210
throttle it back.

2626
02:03:13,210 --> 02:03:15,200
You don't need to be asking so
much because you know they're

2627
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,540
not active, you know they're
not there, so you

2628
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,030
have choices there.

2629
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:22,110
Another similar one is
RequestAnimationFrame.

2630
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:26,060
Animation And
RequestAnimationFrame is a

2631
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:28,340
programmatic way of saying, I'm
going to be putting things

2632
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:31,340
out, I'm going to be drawing
things to the screen.

2633
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:34,450
But Browser, you probably know
what's best as far as

2634
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:38,820
hardware, and so why don't you
take care how exactly to

2635
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:41,890
schedule this?

2636
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:46,470
So there's two good reasons
to use RAF,

2637
02:03:46,470 --> 02:03:47,750
RequestAnimationFrame.

2638
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:49,810
So this is a blog post over
on the IE blog, they've

2639
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:52,140
implemented this in IE 10.

2640
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:55,300
So right here, it's showing
on this top.

2641
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:57,860
Typically in animations,
you'll use either a set

2642
02:03:57,860 --> 02:04:00,640
timeout or a set interval and
just bang it against like 10

2643
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,890
milliseconds.

2644
02:04:01,890 --> 02:04:05,160

2645
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:08,270
Sorry, that's what
this one is.

2646
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:11,260
Every 10 milliseconds, your app
is going to generate like

2647
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:14,830
a new frame of the game and
try and send that out.

2648
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:18,680
But a monitor like this monitor,
this one, they

2649
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:20,210
refresh at 60 Hertz.

2650
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:23,360
So you get a maximum of
60 frames per second.

2651
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:29,420
And if we can make sure that
our game outputs a frame 60

2652
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:32,260
times per second, so then we
can match and sync it up

2653
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:36,080
directly with the time that that
monitor is refreshing,

2654
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:37,320
that's ideal, right?

2655
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:40,130
So RequestAnimationFrame
allows us to do this.

2656
02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:42,270
So we're just like, we got new
content, browser, you take

2657
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:42,970
care of it.

2658
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:45,030
And it will keep the
frame rate as

2659
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:46,920
high fidelity as possible.

2660
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:49,600
Otherwise, these red arrows
indicate that you're actually

2661
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,510
missing frames.

2662
02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:52,260
You're generating all these
frames, and no one

2663
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:54,070
ever even sees it.

2664
02:04:54,070 --> 02:05:01,790
The other good benefit is that
just like page visibility API,

2665
02:05:01,790 --> 02:05:04,350
RequestAnimationFrame knows
if you're looking at it.

2666
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:10,530
So here we have a WebGL
Particles Demo.

2667
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:15,180
Love particle demos,
always looks good.

2668
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:16,770
Cool.

2669
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,790
All right, so what I'm going to
do is as you can imagine,

2670
02:05:19,790 --> 02:05:23,730
this is probably a pretty
intense demo.

2671
02:05:23,730 --> 02:05:28,330
I'm going to bring up my Task
Manager in Chrome and move

2672
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:33,770
that over a little bit more.

2673
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:35,680
All right.

2674
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:38,180
So in the Task Manager, we can
kind of see how much memory is

2675
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:40,060
being consumed, the CPU.

2676
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:44,140
This one over here is the number
of goats teleported,

2677
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:46,090
I'm not sure why that's
in there, but it might

2678
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:48,080
be useful to you.

2679
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:51,960
But the thing that we're looking
at right here is the

2680
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:55,060
CPU usage of Particles Morph.

2681
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:57,800
Right now, it looks like
it's taking up

2682
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:00,346
50%, a decent amount.

2683
02:06:00,346 --> 02:06:04,810
I'm going to switch back to the
other tab, and this figure

2684
02:06:04,810 --> 02:06:05,360
should drop.

2685
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,910
Yes, OK.

2686
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:10,170
So this is because the Particle
Morph demo is using

2687
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:11,420
RequestAnimationFrame.

2688
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:14,110
The browser's like hey, you're
not looking at it.

2689
02:06:14,110 --> 02:06:17,400
I don't need to even
send this out.

2690
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:21,140
This way, my battery is being
conserved as much as possible,

2691
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:22,200
which I like.

2692
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,640
And then when I come back, I
know that it's syncing up

2693
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:26,250
exactly with my Screen Refresh,
so I'm getting the

2694
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:27,500
highest fidelity as possible.

2695
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:30,900

2696
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:33,270
Sweet.

2697
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:38,050
A while ago when HTML5 was
getting a lot of attention,

2698
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:40,820
there was a lot of focus on a
thing called the Device Tag.

2699
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:43,130
And this is what you
think it is.

2700
02:06:43,130 --> 02:06:47,050
It's getting the actual camera
and microphone from your

2701
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:49,320
machine and having that
as a first class

2702
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,330
citizen in the browser.

2703
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:52,220
That's been changed.

2704
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:54,820
And so instead of the Device
Tag, it's now called

2705
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:56,890
getUserMedia.

2706
02:06:56,890 --> 02:06:58,250
And this is essentially
how it works.

2707
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:01,220
You have a video element
function,

2708
02:07:01,220 --> 02:07:02,940
and right over here--

2709
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:07,380
see if I can get that,
it's somewhere--

2710
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:11,726
is this S being passed
into this callback.

2711
02:07:11,726 --> 02:07:15,770
This S is a stream, and so
first, we're going to grab

2712
02:07:15,770 --> 02:07:18,350
this video element, and then
we're going to create an

2713
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:23,240
object URL out of the stream
and set that as the

2714
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:24,960
source of the video.

2715
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:29,190
So this just means, get the
camera, get the microphone,

2716
02:07:29,190 --> 02:07:31,430
and just pipe it through
to this video.

2717
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:34,150
So essentially, what this
looks like is this.

2718
02:07:34,150 --> 02:07:36,904

2719
02:07:36,904 --> 02:07:39,200
Yes.

2720
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,230
All right, cool.

2721
02:07:40,230 --> 02:07:40,800
So here's this.

2722
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,050
This is all built
with JavaScript.

2723
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:44,610

2724
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:45,290
Good.

2725
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:47,530
I like that.

2726
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:50,870
So I can apply CSS Filters,
which showed before, get a

2727
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:53,170
nice effect on there.

2728
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:56,630
And the guy who wrote this demo,
I asked him for this

2729
02:07:56,630 --> 02:07:58,750
feature a few days ago.

2730
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:00,000
I think it'll work.

2731
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,440

2732
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,420
Sweet Polaroid effect where it
has to fade in, but if you

2733
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:09,260
shake it-- yes?

2734
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:10,510
Yeah!

2735
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:14,240

2736
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:16,300
So you can actually, I mean
you can use accelerometer

2737
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:21,110
data, there's events that fire
in MacBook Pros to respond to

2738
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:23,950
that, and you can be able to
say, in this case, I want to

2739
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:26,830
speed up the rendering
of that.

2740
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:29,290
But this is a really
great API, I'm very

2741
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:30,540
happy to have it.

2742
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:33,480

2743
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:36,540
The thing I like about all these
APIs is that they mix up

2744
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:37,740
and they mix well together.

2745
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:40,310
So we're taking the video, and
now we're applying it frame by

2746
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:43,690
frame to a 2D canvas, and that
means we can do something like

2747
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:46,970
[EXPLOSION NOISE], or
just explode that

2748
02:08:46,970 --> 02:08:51,200
video any way we want.

2749
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,750
We can apply any effect.

2750
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:55,880
So in this one, we are taking
the video and now we're piping

2751
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:57,940
it through to WebGL, because
we're going to do a little bit

2752
02:08:57,940 --> 02:08:59,690
more comprehensive changes.

2753
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:02,825
So we can do stuff like this.

2754
02:09:02,825 --> 02:09:06,000

2755
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,560
Anything you want.

2756
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,670
Whoa.

2757
02:09:09,670 --> 02:09:12,695
I saw a Tweet other day, it was
like, "I don't care who

2758
02:09:12,695 --> 02:09:15,440
you are, but put you in front
of a camera doing these

2759
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:18,770
effects, and you will turn into
a five-year-old." And

2760
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:20,530
that is true.

2761
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:22,190
OK.

2762
02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:22,750
I'm just going to move on.

2763
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:25,840
I'll be there all day.

2764
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,090
This brings us to WebRTC.

2765
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:29,100

2766
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:32,430
WebRTC is--

2767
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:34,040
well, OK.

2768
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:39,740
So you might be familiar with
things like, let's see, Google

2769
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:43,390
Talk, G+ Hangouts,
the live video.

2770
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:45,280
Live video's coming to
a lot of things.

2771
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:47,300
You might be familiar with a
small little blue icon where

2772
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:51,050
you video real time chat with
people over the internets.

2773
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:52,030
Good thing.

2774
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:55,220
Wouldn't it be nice if we had
it baked into the browser?

2775
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:55,590
Yes.

2776
02:09:55,590 --> 02:09:56,780
Yes, it would be.

2777
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:59,710
So WebRTC is an effort
for that.

2778
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:02,340
So it's a plugin-free way for
doing real time voice and

2779
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:04,750
video directly inside the
browser, having nice

2780
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:07,480
JavaScript APIs so that we
can just wire it in.

2781
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:11,160
The really cool thing about
this is that because the

2782
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:13,870
browser is handling it, it can
add in a bunch of extra

2783
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:16,130
functionality that would be
super hard for us as end

2784
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:17,290
developers to deal with.

2785
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:21,060
So like echo cancellation, noise
reduction if it's loud

2786
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:24,650
in the back of the room, it's
like focusing on me, automatic

2787
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:27,480
gain control to make sure that
I'm not too loud or too quiet.

2788
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:30,100
If the network connection is
bad, like I'm on a slow

2789
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:31,950
connection but the person I'm
talking to is on a fast

2790
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:34,730
connection, it's just going to
work it out, make sure that

2791
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:38,470
the fidelity of the video just
kind of scales regardless.

2792
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:42,100
So there's a lot of good stuff
kind of baked into it.

2793
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:46,400
And the cool thing is that
WebRTC is a cross-vendor

2794
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:50,690
initiative led by Google, but
Mozilla and Opera are actively

2795
02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:51,350
working on it.

2796
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:54,820
And so we have an implementation
in Google

2797
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:57,540
Chrome now, but we're expecting
to see it in some of

2798
02:10:57,540 --> 02:11:00,530
these other browsers
pretty soon.

2799
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:04,740
As far as how this works, it
is peer to peer, but you do

2800
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:08,030
need to kind of handshake
through a server.

2801
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,910
So this is the way that
it kicks off.

2802
02:11:09,910 --> 02:11:12,620
We set up a new peer connection
through this

2803
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:16,740
server, this is like
the protocol.

2804
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:18,800
And essentially, this should
look familiar.

2805
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,250
We have a getUserMedia again,
where we're going to get our

2806
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:25,340
video and our audio, set up the
stream, and hook that up.

2807
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:30,870
So we're really excited about
this and think that not only

2808
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:34,840
WebRTC but all these features
give you a lot of

2809
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:35,780
functionality.

2810
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:38,280
So I want you to think about
kind of the experiences that

2811
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:40,580
this allows you to provide,
not just the features

2812
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:44,070
themselves but combining them
together, because I think it

2813
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:47,810
has some really good
potential.

2814
02:11:47,810 --> 02:11:51,260
A few resources that
I would recommend.

2815
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:55,930
HTML5 Rocks is a Chrome
Developer relations site where

2816
02:11:55,930 --> 02:11:57,300
we just publish a lot
of this stuff.

2817
02:11:57,300 --> 02:12:01,450
It very much focuses on kind
of the edge of browser

2818
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:03,790
development, so what are the
brand new things coming into

2819
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:07,650
Chrome and other browsers, a lot
of very in-depth tutorials

2820
02:12:07,650 --> 02:12:10,150
as well, great content.

2821
02:12:10,150 --> 02:12:11,650
I'm really, really
happy with it.

2822
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:12,680
Check that out.

2823
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:18,490
HTML5 Please is a site that came
out recently, and it is

2824
02:12:18,490 --> 02:12:24,470
very much focused on like,
people that come to my sites

2825
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:27,040
are real people with real
browsers and those browsers

2826
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,265
might be a little old.

2827
02:12:28,265 --> 02:12:31,300
HTML5 Please is about making
recommendations to you based

2828
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:34,700
on like, is it OK to implement
this thing, what is the fall

2829
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:37,270
back story, can I
use a polyfill?

2830
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:39,160
So basically, recommendations
from people who have been

2831
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:44,310
there before on the right way
to handle every feature.

2832
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:48,340
And HTML5-demos is another site
where you'll find slide

2833
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:52,050
decks like this one and a lot of
other demos as well, so I'd

2834
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:54,120
recommend that out.

2835
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,090
There are two sites.

2836
02:12:55,090 --> 02:12:59,210
One is HTML5-demos,
one is HTML5demos.

2837
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:00,510
Different sites, both good.

2838
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:03,250

2839
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:05,470
And that's it for me.

2840
02:13:05,470 --> 02:13:11,470
These slides are available at
this case sensitive link that

2841
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:15,742
you're welcome to write
down or something.

2842
02:13:15,742 --> 02:13:20,800
It's not very friendly, I'm
sorry, sorry, sorry.

2843
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,550
But Yeah.

2844
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:24,940
Thank you.

2845
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:31,260
[APPLAUSE]

2846
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So it looks
like we've got about 15

2847
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:34,190
minutes for questions.

2848
02:13:34,190 --> 02:13:36,210
So there's plenty of time.

2849
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:39,650
So if anybody has a question
for this gentleman here,

2850
02:13:39,650 --> 02:13:40,900
please shout it out.

2851
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:45,065

2852
02:13:45,065 --> 02:13:47,290
MALE SPEAKER: Does Pointer Lock
only work in Full Screen?

2853
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:48,830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So the question
for the internet

2854
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:53,276
audience was, does the Pointer
Lock only work in Full Screen?

2855
02:13:53,276 --> 02:13:57,310
PAUL IRISH: You know, I was
curious about this as well.

2856
02:13:57,310 --> 02:13:58,830
I'm not sure.

2857
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:01,050
So I believe it does.

2858
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:09,440

2859
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,900
No.

2860
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:14,180
It totally works outside
of full screen.

2861
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:17,256

2862
02:14:17,256 --> 02:14:19,810
I'm not sure.

2863
02:14:19,810 --> 02:14:21,080
This is the page.

2864
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:24,520
Luckily, MDN, Google has
actually been contributing to

2865
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:28,660
MDN recently, and so
I think, yeah, we

2866
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:30,120

2867
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:34,140
And so in lot of cases, the
MDN actually has quite

2868
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:37,520
up-to-date information, on not
only what the compatibility

2869
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:40,330
story is and what browsers this
is available in, but also

2870
02:14:40,330 --> 02:14:40,900
how to use it.

2871
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:44,020
So check that out.

2872
02:14:44,020 --> 02:14:45,292
Sir?

2873
02:14:45,292 --> 02:14:47,772
MALE SPEAKER: Is the video
[INAUDIBLE] just peer-to-peer,

2874
02:14:47,772 --> 02:14:49,570
or could you do group
stuff, group chats?

2875
02:14:49,570 --> 02:14:52,050
PAUL IRISH: Is the video stuff
peer-to-peer or can you do

2876
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:53,640
group stuff?

2877
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:56,880
So WebRTC, it can totally
be group.

2878
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:59,700
You just need the server to
set up the handshakes, but

2879
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:04,610
from there on, it can totally
go scale to a group.

2880
02:15:04,610 --> 02:15:05,860
Very cool.

2881
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:08,519

2882
02:15:08,519 --> 02:15:09,736
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
stream video only

2883
02:15:09,736 --> 02:15:12,420
by server with WebRTC?

2884
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:13,810
PAUL IRISH: Can you
stream video--

2885
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:14,530
MALE SPEAKER: Only through
the server?

2886
02:15:14,530 --> 02:15:15,220
PAUL IRISH: Through
the server?

2887
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,044
MALE SPEAKER: Just to
the server, though.

2888
02:15:17,044 --> 02:15:17,960
Not to another peer.

2889
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:19,680
PAUL IRISH: Ah, so you're saying
you want to do that,

2890
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,020
but without going directly
peer-to-peer?

2891
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:23,362
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

2892
02:15:23,362 --> 02:15:26,300
PAUL IRISH: Ah, OK.

2893
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:26,710
It's a good question.

2894
02:15:26,710 --> 02:15:27,690
MALE SPEAKER: Can you repeat
that question?

2895
02:15:27,690 --> 02:15:30,450
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so the
question is, can you use

2896
02:15:30,450 --> 02:15:33,160
WebRTC without going just
peer-to-peer and instead proxy

2897
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:34,410
it through a server?

2898
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:36,690

2899
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:39,110
So yeah.

2900
02:15:39,110 --> 02:15:41,550
I haven't done it, but I don't
see any reason why you can't

2901
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:43,430
just set up your pure connection
essentially to the

2902
02:15:43,430 --> 02:15:46,270
server instead.

2903
02:15:46,270 --> 02:15:49,090
Yeah, I mean you could totally
manage that at the server

2904
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:51,090
level and just pass
the connection

2905
02:15:51,090 --> 02:15:53,850
right through to itself.

2906
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:56,140
So yeah.

2907
02:15:56,140 --> 02:15:57,390
Yeah?

2908
02:15:57,390 --> 02:15:59,840

2909
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,425
MALE SPEAKER: What kind of API
is it to kind of map what

2910
02:16:02,425 --> 02:16:04,900
buttons people are pressing on
the Gamepad controller to like

2911
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:07,200
actual [INAUDIBLE]?

2912
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:07,930
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

2913
02:16:07,930 --> 02:16:09,180
So this is a tough one.

2914
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:10,430
Let's see, Rob Hawkes Gamepad.

2915
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:17,270

2916
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:20,370
Rob did an excellent
post recently.

2917
02:16:20,370 --> 02:16:23,620
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to find this.

2918
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:27,010
Also look [INAUDIBLE] can bring
up this site right now.

2919
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:27,970
Please?

2920
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:30,230
Yes.

2921
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:31,480
Gamepad, yeah.

2922
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:39,209

2923
02:16:39,209 --> 02:16:41,959
OK, I can't find
this other one.

2924
02:16:41,959 --> 02:16:46,690
So basically right now, with the
Gamepad API, is it returns

2925
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:51,350
to you what the configuration
is, the model, the

2926
02:16:51,350 --> 02:16:55,240
configuration, of the actual
controller, and then it

2927
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:58,640
numbers all the inputs from
one to 30 or something and

2928
02:16:58,640 --> 02:17:02,230
then says that input
12 is now reporting

2929
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:05,719
this stream of events.

2930
02:17:05,719 --> 02:17:08,430
There's two JavaScript libraries
that try and work

2931
02:17:08,430 --> 02:17:10,490
out differences between
controllers.

2932
02:17:10,490 --> 02:17:15,520
One of them is Gamepad JS, and
this is actually made by

2933
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:19,580
Scott, who is the engineer
who built the Gamepad

2934
02:17:19,580 --> 02:17:21,410
implementation for Chrome.

2935
02:17:21,410 --> 02:17:24,350
So it's a good guy to build the
JavaScript library for it.

2936
02:17:24,350 --> 02:17:27,950
So yeah, it tries to smooth
over the differences.

2937
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:32,000
So with different Gamepads, you
will get kind of different

2938
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,099
mappings, and so you essentially
need a dictionary

2939
02:17:35,099 --> 02:17:38,010
to look up like this
to normalize.

2940
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:39,750
They're trying to figure out a
better way to handle that, but

2941
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:40,990
right now, you're essentially
looking at

2942
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:42,290
one of these libraries.

2943
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:45,510
But these are well-tested and
kind of where the entire

2944
02:17:45,510 --> 02:17:49,500
community is focusing its
effort, so it's a good set-up

2945
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:52,790
to have.

2946
02:17:52,790 --> 02:17:55,290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More
questions?

2947
02:17:55,290 --> 02:17:57,309
MALE SPEAKER: Does that
CSS drop shadow

2948
02:17:57,309 --> 02:17:59,260
work with alpha channels?

2949
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:00,459
PAUL IRISH: Work with
alpha changes?

2950
02:18:00,459 --> 02:18:01,610
MALE SPEAKER: Alpha channels.

2951
02:18:01,610 --> 02:18:02,554
PAUL IRISH: Channels?

2952
02:18:02,554 --> 02:18:05,152
Like you have an alpha
channel on--

2953
02:18:05,152 --> 02:18:06,402
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

2954
02:18:06,402 --> 02:18:08,589

2955
02:18:08,589 --> 02:18:09,080
PAUL IRISH: Ah.

2956
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:10,660
Well, hm.

2957
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:12,417
MALE SPEAKER: Because like,
what's the point of

2958
02:18:12,417 --> 02:18:15,340
[INAUDIBLE] drop shadow,
[INAUDIBLE]?

2959
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:18,969
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, there's a very
large debate regarding

2960
02:18:18,969 --> 02:18:21,780
the sorts of shadows that are
available, and if I have like

2961
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:26,940
an SVG shape or some
non-rectangle, if I have--

2962
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:27,544
not text.

2963
02:18:27,544 --> 02:18:30,020
Text has its own shadow.

2964
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:31,469
Yeah, so there's been a big--

2965
02:18:31,469 --> 02:18:34,190
so I can't cut out a
circle out of this

2966
02:18:34,190 --> 02:18:37,110
unless I used Clip.

2967
02:18:37,110 --> 02:18:38,040
No, clip wouldn't work.

2968
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:40,070
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

2969
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:41,954
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

2970
02:18:41,954 --> 02:18:43,889
PNG would not work.

2971
02:18:43,889 --> 02:18:46,465

2972
02:18:46,465 --> 02:18:53,049
So the filter is actually,
let's see, FXTF filters.

2973
02:18:53,049 --> 02:18:55,850
So the spec actually comes
over here from the Filter

2974
02:18:55,850 --> 02:19:01,110
Effects cross-functional group,
and this is basically a

2975
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:04,100
collaboration of people who have
been working on SVG, and

2976
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:07,590
then people in CSS land.

2977
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:10,629
And so all the filters, while
I was showing kind of the

2978
02:19:10,629 --> 02:19:16,700
shorthand filters of these guys,
it actually takes in a

2979
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:18,080
lot of these primitives.

2980
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,790
Those are just shorthand for
mixing up the filter

2981
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:25,360
primitives, and all of these
come directly from SVG.

2982
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:27,969
And because they come
from SVG, SVG is all

2983
02:19:27,969 --> 02:19:29,730
about custom shapes.

2984
02:19:29,730 --> 02:19:32,740
And so while I can't bring up
a demo that uses a custom

2985
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:36,650
shape in these filters, I have
no doubt that it works.

2986
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:42,750
We also, there is hardware
acceleration for--

2987
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:45,400
I think we landed full hardware
acceleration for all

2988
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,400
these filters in Canary.

2989
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:53,530
So that just means they're
faster, which is a good thing.

2990
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:54,890
Quick question on--

2991
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:56,420
it seems like you guys
have implemented

2992
02:19:56,420 --> 02:19:58,540
everything that Flash did.

2993
02:19:58,540 --> 02:19:59,500
Is there anything left?

2994
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,070
I feel like you guys--

2995
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:01,954
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

2996
02:20:01,954 --> 02:20:03,722
Good question.

2997
02:20:03,722 --> 02:20:07,280
You know, I was curious
about this as well.

2998
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,530
What is left?

2999
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:10,730

3000
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:14,270
There are a lot of wishes.

3001
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:17,680
I think part of is building
on top of things.

3002
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:23,740
We just finished off Mutation
Observers, which is

3003
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:30,620
essentially an iteration on
Mutation Events, but they're

3004
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:31,980
far, far more performing.

3005
02:20:31,980 --> 02:20:35,190
So with Mutation Events, you
would subscribe to like DOM

3006
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:37,985
sub-tree modified, and it would
tell you if anything in

3007
02:20:37,985 --> 02:20:40,210
the DOM had changed.

3008
02:20:40,210 --> 02:20:42,160
People use this all the time
for Chrome extensions, for

3009
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,630
Grease Monkey scripts, when
you're hooking into a third

3010
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:46,450
party web page and you want to
know if somebody clicked the

3011
02:20:46,450 --> 02:20:48,780
New Tweet button because you're
going to add some part

3012
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:51,760
of the UI to it, but
things are very not

3013
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:52,500
performing at all.

3014
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:57,090
Mutation Observers are a better
way of tracking these

3015
02:20:57,090 --> 02:21:01,500
changes, and it's like
500 times more

3016
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,150
performing than the other.

3017
02:21:03,150 --> 02:21:05,050
So in some cases, it's
things like that.

3018
02:21:05,050 --> 02:21:08,750
Other cases, I've heard, I want
Photoshop's Blend modes,

3019
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:12,260
like Darker and Multiply
against DOM.

3020
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:16,310
So like this DIV, I want to
multiply against this other

3021
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:23,760
DIV. Filters might get us
part of the way there.

3022
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:28,960
But yeah, there's a lot coming
in CSS in particular that I'm

3023
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:29,440
happy about.

3024
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:33,110
So like CSS as a language
is limited.

3025
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:35,490
Mix-ins, so things that you
might be familiar with from

3026
02:21:35,490 --> 02:21:38,950
Sass and LESS and the other
preprocessors of variables,

3027
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:42,040
mix-ins, selector nesting.

3028
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:45,610
There's specs for all these
things, and some of it's

3029
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:48,410
starting to land in Canary.

3030
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:52,170
So CSS variables
in particular.

3031
02:21:52,170 --> 02:21:54,930
We do have a spec for
it that [INAUDIBLE]

3032
02:21:54,930 --> 02:22:00,950
Atkins, who's actually here at
South By, is working on.

3033
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:01,970
Here it is.

3034
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:05,390
And our engineering team is
actually implementing this

3035
02:22:05,390 --> 02:22:08,210
like as we speak.

3036
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:11,080
So we're going to be expecting
to see some of this stuff just

3037
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:12,190
happening for real,
and I'm excited,

3038
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:13,920
especially in the CSS land.

3039
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,370
Layout, we have grid layout,
the brand new Flex Box, the

3040
02:22:18,370 --> 02:22:21,680
Regions that I showed.

3041
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:27,070
And I would expect the DOM
to be better as well.

3042
02:22:27,070 --> 02:22:29,530
Right now, the DOM, like people
use jQuery because DOM

3043
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:30,780
APIs are annoying.

3044
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:33,060

3045
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:35,370
And I hope we're going
to see that improve.

3046
02:22:35,370 --> 02:22:37,050
There's lot of people that want
to make that better, make

3047
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:38,300
that more performant.

3048
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:40,940

3049
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:42,190
Any other questions?

3050
02:22:42,190 --> 02:22:46,400

3051
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,380
No?

3052
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:49,610
Cool.

3053
02:22:49,610 --> 02:22:55,000
Well again, HTML5 Rocks,
good stuff.

3054
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,890
And if you have any more
questions, feel free to Tweet

3055
02:22:57,890 --> 02:22:59,860
at me or hit be on G+.

3056
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:03,220
I do post a lot of really cool
stuff about HTML5 stuff,

3057
02:23:03,220 --> 02:23:06,960
Chrome Dev tools, on Google+,
try and link it up via Twitter

3058
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,450
when I can.

3059
02:23:08,450 --> 02:23:11,200
So good things, check
that out.

3060
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:12,460
So thank you guys,
appreciate it.

3061
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:13,120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you, Paul.

3062
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:20,424
[APPLAUSE]

3063
02:23:20,424 --> 02:23:22,060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right, and
coming up to the stage, we

3064
02:23:22,060 --> 02:23:24,990
have both Josh and Chris, and
they're going to be talking

3065
02:23:24,990 --> 02:23:27,615
about making your maps beautiful
and interactive.

3066
02:23:27,615 --> 02:23:30,770

3067
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:34,790
I'd also like to remind you, if
you want to see this after

3068
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:37,380
we're done today, we're
recording this whole thing and

3069
02:23:37,380 --> 02:23:40,730
it's going to be available on
the Google Developers' YouTube

3070
02:23:40,730 --> 02:23:42,010
channel page.

3071
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:45,810
So you can just do a quick
search for that and get all of

3072
02:23:45,810 --> 02:23:49,290
these sessions on video
at home later.

3073
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:51,330
Maybe there's something you
missed, or you wanted an

3074
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:53,295
instant replay of one
of Paul's slides.

3075
02:23:53,295 --> 02:23:54,545
You can get all that.

3076
02:23:54,545 --> 02:24:06,300

3077
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:07,756
JOSH LIVNI: [INAUDIBLE] like
a couple minutes here

3078
02:24:07,756 --> 02:24:08,140
for people to settle?

3079
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:08,410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
we'll give you a

3080
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:09,790
couple minutes to settle.

3081
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:12,210
We do have this one last
session about maps.

3082
02:24:12,210 --> 02:24:14,400
If you're in the back and you'd
like a seat, we have

3083
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:15,840
some lovely seats up here.

3084
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:18,960
They're green, they're
triangular, and they make me

3085
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:21,610
feel a little bit like I'm
in elementary school.

3086
02:24:21,610 --> 02:24:22,350
You see these chairs?

3087
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:24,885
These are cool.

3088
02:24:24,885 --> 02:24:26,370
A little desk would be great,
but you see how they have the

3089
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:27,300
hole in the back?

3090
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:29,350
Remember that from school?

3091
02:24:29,350 --> 02:24:31,442
I don't know why that
hole's there.

3092
02:24:31,442 --> 02:24:31,900
MALE SPEAKER: Gum.

3093
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:34,910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you can put
the gum through there?

3094
02:24:34,910 --> 02:24:37,450
So yeah, please do come
on up and grab a seat.

3095
02:24:37,450 --> 02:24:39,360
We do have some more
seats available.

3096
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:41,230
And why don't you guys go
ahead and take it away?

3097
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:46,890

3098
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:47,800
JOSH LIVNI: All right.

3099
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:48,870
I'm going to make
a run for it.

3100
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:52,810
Sorry for this noise that's
about to happen.

3101
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:54,280
Made it!

3102
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:56,642
We have some speaker effect.

3103
02:24:56,642 --> 02:24:57,130
All right.

3104
02:24:57,130 --> 02:24:58,400
Should we get started?

3105
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
let's get started.

3106
02:25:00,020 --> 02:25:00,250
JOSH LIVNI: OK.

3107
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:00,930
Hi, everybody.

3108
02:25:00,930 --> 02:25:02,670
So my name is Josh.

3109
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:03,310
This is Chris.

3110
02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:05,940
We're on the Maps Developer
Relations Team.

3111
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:08,060
CHRIS BROADFOOT: We're going to
talk today about beautiful

3112
02:25:08,060 --> 02:25:11,560
maps, so making your geographic
information

3113
02:25:11,560 --> 02:25:13,530
beautiful and interactive.

3114
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:15,190
And so we're going to be showing
some cool things we've

3115
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:19,070
been working on, various Google
APIs, a whole bunch of

3116
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:22,270
awesome HTML5 stuff.

3117
02:25:22,270 --> 02:25:26,140
So let's give a bit of
context to this talk.

3118
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:29,475
JOSH LIVNI: Yep, here we have
a very early map, Mayan.

3119
02:25:29,475 --> 02:25:31,140
There's a lot of things you
notice about it, a little

3120
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:32,940
different from the
modern web maps.

3121
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:36,740
It's smaller, it has a
legend at the top.

3122
02:25:36,740 --> 02:25:41,040
It has none of the HTML5 stuff
that Paul was going over.

3123
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,440
And our intent is to try to fix
some of these things in

3124
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:45,355
future slides, but it's good
to see where maps started.

3125
02:25:45,355 --> 02:25:46,960
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Not
very interactive.

3126
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:48,740
JOSH LIVNI: Not very.

3127
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:50,440
So here we get a little
bit interactive.

3128
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:55,020
This is about 15 years ago,
state of the art GIS system.

3129
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,570
Lots of data, people starting
to make kind of these

3130
02:25:57,570 --> 02:25:59,550
interactive maps where
you could toggle

3131
02:25:59,550 --> 02:26:01,510
lots of check boxes.

3132
02:26:01,510 --> 02:26:03,280
CHRIS BROADFOOT: The sad thing
here is you have to press

3133
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,060
radio buttons to navigate
the world.

3134
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:07,140
JOSH LIVNI: And press Redraw
to redraw it, and each map

3135
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:10,325
tile is dynamically done
for you custom.

3136
02:26:10,325 --> 02:26:13,410
But it was a bit slow, not
super user-friendly.

3137
02:26:13,410 --> 02:26:14,450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Unfortunately,
some people

3138
02:26:14,450 --> 02:26:15,810
still make maps like this.

3139
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:17,940
JOSH LIVNI: Yes, they do.

3140
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:19,180
So things got better.

3141
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:21,250
We got all the important
countries on an

3142
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:23,500
early Google Map.

3143
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:26,040
The key here is we pre-rendered
the tiles in

3144
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:28,860
advance, and so we came up with
this idea of the slippy

3145
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:30,920
map, where you could call around
and everything's kind

3146
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:33,350
of instantaneous feeling
and just really

3147
02:26:33,350 --> 02:26:34,450
dynamic, nice feel.

3148
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:35,560
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So you're not
loading everything as you try

3149
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:36,180
to look around.

3150
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:36,560
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

3151
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:39,240
So it's not super custom, we've
decided in advance what

3152
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,390
the look and feel is, but
you get this really nice

3153
02:26:41,390 --> 02:26:41,740
interaction.

3154
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:44,300
So this is kind of the start of
the new age of interactive

3155
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:46,060
maps, not that long ago.

3156
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:48,570

3157
02:26:48,570 --> 02:26:51,340
Here we've added some more
countries and some more data,

3158
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:53,890
and tons and tons of stuff
on these map tiles.

3159
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:56,440
So these map tiles seem like
they're pre-rendered, but

3160
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:58,260
actually, there's a lot of
interesting customizations you

3161
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:00,660
can do with them when you go to
the Google Maps, and that's

3162
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:03,610
what we're going to take
a look at here.

3163
02:27:03,610 --> 02:27:05,010
Little did you know, perhaps.

3164
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:06,750
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this
is Styled Maps.

3165
02:27:06,750 --> 02:27:10,230
This was launched at
Google I/O in 2010.

3166
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:14,130
And so it basically allows you
to change the colors and

3167
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:16,180
display of all the
map features.

3168
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:19,840
So here we've got our beautiful
landscape is black,

3169
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:20,980
roads as pink.

3170
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:22,660
This is one of my favorite
styles, by the way.

3171
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:23,320
JOSH LIVNI: He's a professional
cartographer.

3172
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:24,900
That's why we hired him.

3173
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:25,400
CHRIS BROADFOOT: That's right.

3174
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:27,780
JOSH LIVNI: But you switch back
and forth between the map

3175
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:29,660
and the other version there.

3176
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:31,550
And you can see that what we're
actually doing is we're

3177
02:27:31,550 --> 02:27:34,040
rendering these tiles
dynamically for any style that

3178
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:37,110
you want to have. Maybe show
them the label style.

3179
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:37,960
And the idea-- oh, go ahead.

3180
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:39,490
CHRIS BROADFOOT: This is one
of my favorite maps.

3181
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:42,447
It's a map without a
map, just labels.

3182
02:27:42,447 --> 02:27:43,301
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, you
zoom in and out?

3183
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:44,830
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Just
an experiment.

3184
02:27:44,830 --> 02:27:46,490
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, and so the
idea here is we can provide a

3185
02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:47,880
really custom experience
for you.

3186
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:49,680
But again, this is
not your data.

3187
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:52,880
It's a backdrop you can
use to tell your

3188
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,150
story with your data.

3189
02:27:54,150 --> 02:27:57,640
So be sure you always customize
the background and

3190
02:27:57,640 --> 02:28:02,070
that your sort of pre-tiled
images are telling

3191
02:28:02,070 --> 02:28:02,990
the story you want.

3192
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:04,230
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So you
can use this to

3193
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:05,530
bring your data alive.

3194
02:28:05,530 --> 02:28:08,310
So if you're displaying stuff
on a Google Map, you might

3195
02:28:08,310 --> 02:28:10,855
want to remove roads if they're
not so important for

3196
02:28:10,855 --> 02:28:13,250
your data, it's really cool.

3197
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:13,720
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

3198
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:16,130
Our base map is really designed,
the story we're

3199
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:18,480
trying to tell, which may not be
the exact same story you're

3200
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:21,120
trying to tell, like where all
the freeways are, or where all

3201
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:22,465
the public transit.

3202
02:28:22,465 --> 02:28:23,940
Anyway, let's get to
your data, which is

3203
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:24,730
what the talk's about.

3204
02:28:24,730 --> 02:28:28,050
So here's a bunch of trees
mapped in San Francisco, a

3205
02:28:28,050 --> 02:28:29,720
couple hundred thousand trees.

3206
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:33,140
There's lots of it, and this is,
I guess, green dot fever,

3207
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:35,540
a variety of the red dot fever
that comes around when you're

3208
02:28:35,540 --> 02:28:37,120
trying to, man, I have
a lot of data.

3209
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:38,720
How am I going to put
it on the map?

3210
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:41,980
And the classic way of doing
this, since browsers until

3211
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:44,140
very recently could only handle
maybe a few hundred, a

3212
02:28:44,140 --> 02:28:46,470
few thousand points, is I'm
going to have to take this

3213
02:28:46,470 --> 02:28:50,170
data, put it on a server, render
up my own tiles, and

3214
02:28:50,170 --> 02:28:52,100
overlay those tiles
on top of the map.

3215
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:53,050
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
pretty hard.

3216
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:53,320
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

3217
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:53,590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
a lot of work.

3218
02:28:53,590 --> 02:28:55,700
JOSH LIVNI: There's a big stack
of things you have to

3219
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:57,370
take care of and think about.

3220
02:28:57,370 --> 02:28:59,312
We have some tools to make this
easy, but this is kind of

3221
02:28:59,312 --> 02:28:59,830
what you're seeing here.

3222
02:28:59,830 --> 02:29:03,070
These are rendered tiles, and
then we just display these

3223
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:05,784
PNGs on top of the map.

3224
02:29:05,784 --> 02:29:06,760
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Made with
the map, of course.

3225
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:08,420
JOSH LIVNI: You can click on
them and get some information

3226
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:10,440
back, kind of makes a call to
the server and says what's

3227
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:13,050
here, and here's a tree and
a species and whatnot.

3228
02:29:13,050 --> 02:29:14,240
But your interaction's
limited.

3229
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:16,910
And again, you sort of have to
get it all through this work

3230
02:29:16,910 --> 02:29:18,440
flow of rendering tiles.

3231
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:21,100
So what if you could actually
just use JavaScript to put

3232
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:22,540
your data on top of the map?

3233
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:25,020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this is one
of the solutions to this

3234
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:26,250
big data problem.

3235
02:29:26,250 --> 02:29:28,400
It's called clustering.

3236
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:31,960
Unfortunately, it scales only up
to maybe tens of thousands

3237
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:33,930
of points, something
like that.

3238
02:29:33,930 --> 02:29:35,200
It's quite pretty.

3239
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,170
JOSH LIVNI: And we can't display
all 10,000 either, so

3240
02:29:37,170 --> 02:29:39,220
we've got to only display
a few hundred at a time.

3241
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:40,870
Here's there's much
less than that.

3242
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:43,160
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You sort of get
sort of a cheap heat map.

3243
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:46,690
So you sort of get a sense of
where all the points are.

3244
02:29:46,690 --> 02:29:48,220
JOSH LIVNI: Now, there's some
stories that this is actually

3245
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:49,000
conducive to.

3246
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,580
So it's actually sometimes great
to do a Marker Clusterer

3247
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:53,270
for certain types of stories.

3248
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:54,690
But it's just important to
remember the inherent

3249
02:29:54,690 --> 02:29:59,200
limitation here is, we can't be
displaying a million points

3250
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,670
in JavaScript on the browser.

3251
02:30:00,670 --> 02:30:03,050
So this is one of the techniques
to get around that.

3252
02:30:03,050 --> 02:30:05,700
CHRIS BROADFOOT: As you said, I
mean, get individual points,

3253
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:08,070
so you can click on them,
whatever you want.

3254
02:30:08,070 --> 02:30:10,040
JOSH LIVNI: So keep in mind, the
Marker Clusterer, you have

3255
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:12,590
a bunch, a few thousand points,
you want to display

3256
02:30:12,590 --> 02:30:14,040
them on the map.

3257
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:16,240
And then we should look at what
the future holds, or the

3258
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:17,320
current now.

3259
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:19,460
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this an
experiment I did it would have

3260
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:22,400
been a few months ago now, just
to see how many points I

3261
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:23,990
could throw at the browser.

3262
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:27,330
So these are 10,000 crimes
in San Francisco

3263
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:28,510
over a one-month period.

3264
02:30:28,510 --> 02:30:30,040
JOSH LIVNI: A very safe city.

3265
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:32,450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And I decided,
I just want to render

3266
02:30:32,450 --> 02:30:35,710
all these and see the places
I should avoid when I'm

3267
02:30:35,710 --> 02:30:37,590
visiting the city.

3268
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:39,890
So I'm coloring different
types of crime

3269
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:41,130
with different colors.

3270
02:30:41,130 --> 02:30:44,680
And as they are drawn on top of
each other, they stack up,

3271
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:47,180
so you can sort of see hot
spots of crime activity.

3272
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,900
JOSH LIVNI: And the important
bit here is instead of

3273
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:51,620
rendering these as tiles in an
overlay, we're just throwing

3274
02:30:51,620 --> 02:30:54,470
all the vector data down to
the browser, the browser's

3275
02:30:54,470 --> 02:30:55,860
displaying these using canvas.

3276
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:58,160
So finally, HTML5 has arrived.

3277
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:59,710
Canvas.

3278
02:30:59,710 --> 02:31:02,940
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So as I zoom
in, I just keep rendering.

3279
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:04,710
JOSH LIVNI: OK, all right.

3280
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:07,010
So here is a bit of
a morbid map.

3281
02:31:07,010 --> 02:31:12,250
This is the last seven to 10
years of traffic fatalities in

3282
02:31:12,250 --> 02:31:13,620
the United States.

3283
02:31:13,620 --> 02:31:15,980
We're looking at about-- go
ahead and type "fatals" into

3284
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:19,940
the box there, and maybe
zoom in somewhere.

3285
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:23,200
What we're looking at here is
about, I think, 300,000

3286
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:26,000
accidents or so.

3287
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:26,670
Maybe just--

3288
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:27,840
CHRIS BROADFOOT: 2,000.

3289
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,540
JOSH LIVNI: 278,000.

3290
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:30,540
And if you zoom in somewhere
else, there's a couple

3291
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:31,100
interesting things to note.

3292
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:33,556
Maybe zoom into Austin.

3293
02:31:33,556 --> 02:31:35,475
There we go.

3294
02:31:35,475 --> 02:31:38,360
So here's a bunch of points, and
what you can see is about

3295
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:42,250
700 accidents or so.

3296
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:43,890
Move the slider, the
size of the slider.

3297
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:45,830
One of the things you'll notice
as you zoom in and out,

3298
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:48,310
you can change it to a really
gruesome-looking map with a

3299
02:31:48,310 --> 02:31:50,370
lot of accidents, or maybe
something a little more

3300
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:52,330
subtle, you're trying to get
a different point across.

3301
02:31:52,330 --> 02:31:55,790
We can style them according to
different colors, and I'm kind

3302
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:57,560
of contradicting what I said,
you can't get a lot

3303
02:31:57,560 --> 02:31:58,350
of points in here.

3304
02:31:58,350 --> 02:32:01,730
And what we're doing here is
we're using WebGL to render,

3305
02:32:01,730 --> 02:32:04,470
in the graphics shader, a
lot and a lot of data.

3306
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:06,160
We can render a significant
amount.

3307
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:06,610
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Millions.

3308
02:32:06,610 --> 02:32:07,810
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah,
many millions.

3309
02:32:07,810 --> 02:32:09,680
It's pretty exciting, it's kind
of a new world where we

3310
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:11,790
can send the vector data over,
and actually render these in

3311
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:14,020
the browser, and actually start
to run different types

3312
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:15,130
of analysis or filtering.

3313
02:32:15,130 --> 02:32:16,550
So a really simple example,
go ahead and

3314
02:32:16,550 --> 02:32:17,760
hit that filter there.

3315
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,060
You've probably heard
most accidents

3316
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:20,460
happen close to home.

3317
02:32:20,460 --> 02:32:24,790
So I've just got a filter that
runs on the distance between

3318
02:32:24,790 --> 02:32:27,730
where the accident occurred and
where that car driver is

3319
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:28,680
registered.

3320
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:31,120
So you can see as you drag it
on the way up to 100, say,

3321
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:32,760
most of the accidents go away.

3322
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:36,110
Most people's accidents occur
within less than 100

3323
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:39,410
kilometers, 60 miles or
so, of their house.

3324
02:32:39,410 --> 02:32:42,672
So maybe zoom out
to Florida, say.

3325
02:32:42,672 --> 02:32:43,020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I don't
know where that is.

3326
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:46,340
JOSH LIVNI: There it
is in bottom right.

3327
02:32:46,340 --> 02:32:48,200
So we have this Place API drop
down for people like this.

3328
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:48,580
It's pretty good.

3329
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:51,170
You just type in whatever you
want, it takes you there.

3330
02:32:51,170 --> 02:32:51,650
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Whoa.

3331
02:32:51,650 --> 02:32:51,940
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

3332
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:54,660
So you can see there's a lot
of accidents that happened.

3333
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:56,640
It's crazy--

3334
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:58,650
more than 100 miles away from
home, probably a lot of people

3335
02:32:58,650 --> 02:32:59,565
there as tourists.

3336
02:32:59,565 --> 02:33:01,320
So you can kind of get an idea,
here's a tourist spot,

3337
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:02,680
everyone goes there,
has an accident.

3338
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:05,460
The locals still have a lot of
accidents, but there's still

3339
02:33:05,460 --> 02:33:06,340
plenty left for that.

3340
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:09,340
Whereas you go to a city say
Sacramento, San Francisco, and

3341
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:11,510
you drag that away, you'll see
almost all of the accidents--

3342
02:33:11,510 --> 02:33:13,270
maybe try, or Austin--

3343
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:14,520
most of the accidents happen.

3344
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:17,040

3345
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,320
Where did they go?

3346
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:20,060
Make it a little bigger.

3347
02:33:20,060 --> 02:33:23,660
Maybe that data didn't load.

3348
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:24,156
Interesting.

3349
02:33:24,156 --> 02:33:25,590
There we go.

3350
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:29,060
So anyway, you get the general
idea here, which is I can

3351
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,930
throw a lot of points, do cool
techniques kind of like Paul

3352
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:34,510
was showing, animate these,
filter them, style them based

3353
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:37,840
on some attributes, and at about
60 frames a second, get

3354
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:39,480
some pretty dynamic results.

3355
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:42,970
So let's scoot over to
quick example using

3356
02:33:42,970 --> 02:33:43,790
the exact same stack.

3357
02:33:43,790 --> 02:33:45,740
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
a very bloody map.

3358
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:46,300
JOSH LIVNI: Not accidents.

3359
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:50,740
This is just census blocks sized
by population, it's a

3360
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:51,560
little bit better.

3361
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:54,970
So if you zoom out here, just
a couple zoom-outs, you can

3362
02:33:54,970 --> 02:33:57,710
see I've got millions
of census blocks

3363
02:33:57,710 --> 02:33:58,650
here, that's good.

3364
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:01,080
And you can drag the
filter if you want.

3365
02:34:01,080 --> 02:34:04,730
And not especially amazing map,
except to show off I can

3366
02:34:04,730 --> 02:34:08,450
display millions and millions
of points in WebGL on top of

3367
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:11,710
the map pretty easily, and this
is being run through App

3368
02:34:11,710 --> 02:34:12,420
Engine to CloudSQL.

3369
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:15,930
So no special spatial database
or anything, just toss it into

3370
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:18,780
MySQL, stream it over in binary
format directly to the

3371
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:21,680
graphics card, and then I can
work with this in JavaScript

3372
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:23,645
to style and do analysis.

3373
02:34:23,645 --> 02:34:25,910
So pretty cool stuff when you
have really big data that you

3374
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:27,850
want to have an interactive
feel with.

3375
02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:29,435
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, on
the topic of big data--

3376
02:34:29,435 --> 02:34:31,900
I say data, actually.

3377
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:33,780
So this is a data set that I've
been playing around with

3378
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:35,180
for the last few weeks.

3379
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:36,430
It's really awesome.

3380
02:34:36,430 --> 02:34:38,080
You should check it out if
you're interested in

3381
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:39,250
this kind of stuff.

3382
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:42,230
It's 25,000 cab trips
in the San Francisco

3383
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:44,890
area over a week period.

3384
02:34:44,890 --> 02:34:48,280
So you've got here the cab ID,
the time, and the location of

3385
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:51,000
the cab at that time.

3386
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,260
So the cab ID's useful because
you can string together a

3387
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:56,240
whole bunch of these points and
figure out the path of a

3388
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:58,480
particular cab.

3389
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:02,190
So this equates to over
one million points.

3390
02:35:02,190 --> 02:35:06,010
So similar in vain to Josh's
visualization, we can just

3391
02:35:06,010 --> 02:35:08,290
display them all at once.

3392
02:35:08,290 --> 02:35:12,000
So of course all of these
points, one million points all

3393
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,780
stacked on top of each other
doesn't look great.

3394
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:18,870
So each point, I've got a very
small amount of opacity, so

3395
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:20,380
they sort of stack up.

3396
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:23,840
And you can immediately see
the most-traveled streets.

3397
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:26,740
So just for a moment, imagine
that the base map wasn't here,

3398
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:30,120
you'd sort of be able to get a
sense of the layout of the San

3399
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:32,910
Francisco city, which
is pretty cool, just

3400
02:35:32,910 --> 02:35:35,300
from this raw data.

3401
02:35:35,300 --> 02:35:36,760
And then we can do something
like take a

3402
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:38,120
selection of that data.

3403
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:40,730
So here I'm taking
a slice of time.

3404
02:35:40,730 --> 02:35:45,210
So from 4:00 PM on Sunday to
4:08, and you can just see the

3405
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:48,060
trail of that particular car.

3406
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:49,390
JOSH LIVNI: Can you zoom it
in a bit there, yeah.

3407
02:35:49,390 --> 02:35:52,300
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So this is sort
of interesting, but you

3408
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:54,080
can't get a sense of the
direction that the car is

3409
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:55,440
traveling in.

3410
02:35:55,440 --> 02:35:59,770
So we can apply some techniques,
color and scale,

3411
02:35:59,770 --> 02:36:04,110
to sort of show a trail behind
the cab's current position at

3412
02:36:04,110 --> 02:36:06,200
the end of that time slice.

3413
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:08,910
This is sort of cool.

3414
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:10,630
You get a sense of direction.

3415
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:13,390
And then we can do some really
cool things like animate

3416
02:36:13,390 --> 02:36:15,820
through, and you really
get a sense of

3417
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:17,085
the flow of the traffic.

3418
02:36:17,085 --> 02:36:19,760

3419
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:25,090
So just by moving the slice
of time slowly--

3420
02:36:25,090 --> 02:36:29,290
so we're doing about five
minutes of time every second,

3421
02:36:29,290 --> 02:36:30,960
something like that--

3422
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:32,550
you sort of get a
sense of flow.

3423
02:36:32,550 --> 02:36:35,530
And if I did this through the
whole data set, you'd cycle

3424
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:38,670
through the days of the week
and be able to see the busy

3425
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:39,920
and the quiet periods.

3426
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:42,020

3427
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:44,350
That's sort of cool, but let's
do some more interesting

3428
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:46,440
things, such as coloring.

3429
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:50,430
So here I've applied a color
to each point, and it's the

3430
02:36:50,430 --> 02:36:52,810
speed of the car at that
point in time.

3431
02:36:52,810 --> 02:36:55,850
So I've used the cab ID to
figure out where it's been

3432
02:36:55,850 --> 02:36:57,410
traveling, the speed.

3433
02:36:57,410 --> 02:36:58,310
And so this is sort of cool.

3434
02:36:58,310 --> 02:37:01,140
Just by plotting all these
points, you get a sense of

3435
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:03,690
where the traffic
in the city is.

3436
02:37:03,690 --> 02:37:10,300
And if I just zoom in, it sort
of fades out, and we can

3437
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:14,410
provide a tool like this to sort
of bump up the opacity,

3438
02:37:14,410 --> 02:37:16,990
so you can really start to
explore the data set.

3439
02:37:16,990 --> 02:37:19,680
And so the interesting thing
that you might see here is

3440
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:24,440
that around the Market Street
area downtown, the GPS is

3441
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,310
really noisy.

3442
02:37:25,310 --> 02:37:28,710
So you can sort of see, as
opposed to really straight

3443
02:37:28,710 --> 02:37:32,370
streets, you've got all this
sort of fuzzy points.

3444
02:37:32,370 --> 02:37:34,150
JOSH LIVNI: Tall buildings
are not good for GPS.

3445
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:35,230
[INAUDIBLE].

3446
02:37:35,230 --> 02:37:36,415
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah,
apparently cars can't drive

3447
02:37:36,415 --> 02:37:37,665
through buildings.

3448
02:37:37,665 --> 02:37:40,040

3449
02:37:40,040 --> 02:37:43,620
So we can combine these
techniques to sort of get a

3450
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:47,350
colored squiggle moving around
the screen, which I thought

3451
02:37:47,350 --> 02:37:48,580
was pretty cool.

3452
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:53,217
When I first did this, I sort
of just animated through it

3453
02:37:53,217 --> 02:37:58,190
and stared at it for five
minutes, as I will do now for

3454
02:37:58,190 --> 02:37:58,650
five minutes.

3455
02:37:58,650 --> 02:38:00,518
MALE SPEAKER: Can you talk a
little bit about what your

3456
02:38:00,518 --> 02:38:05,200
data set actually looks
like to power that?

3457
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:05,590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, sure.

3458
02:38:05,590 --> 02:38:08,100
Let's just look at the next
thing first. So this is a

3459
02:38:08,100 --> 02:38:10,860
one-hour slice of time.

3460
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:14,350
And this is great, because you
can just scroll through and

3461
02:38:14,350 --> 02:38:18,530
get a sense of the traffic
flows in that hour.

3462
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:23,260
So you see, it gets really quiet
around four AM, and as I

3463
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:27,010
keep scrolling through, you sort
of see the sort of more

3464
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:29,480
macro level of the flows of
traffic throughout the week.

3465
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:32,070

3466
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:36,050
And it gets really busy
on Friday night.

3467
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:40,100
And you can see that traffic
starts to get pretty bad

3468
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:42,870
around 5:00 PM, you notice
people are heading out to

3469
02:38:42,870 --> 02:38:44,120
dinner and whatnot.

3470
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:46,870

3471
02:38:46,870 --> 02:38:50,420
And then Saturday night gets
really busy again.

3472
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:53,750
And you can do cool things like,
if we just go ahead and

3473
02:38:53,750 --> 02:38:57,150
display the whole data set,
we can go and zoom in.

3474
02:38:57,150 --> 02:39:00,730
So this area looks
a bit funny.

3475
02:39:00,730 --> 02:39:02,920
So it's sort of
interesting-looking for these

3476
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:06,720
red areas where cars
tend to stop.

3477
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:10,260
And so another cool one's down
here near the airport, some

3478
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:14,390
sort of waiting bay or
something like that.

3479
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:15,050
Sort of cool.

3480
02:39:15,050 --> 02:39:18,440
And this is really awesome,
because you can zoom down into

3481
02:39:18,440 --> 02:39:21,890
a particular point, which
is sort of amazing.

3482
02:39:21,890 --> 02:39:23,270
JOSH LIVNI: Let's hop back to
that data set to the guy's

3483
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:25,420
question, because what I think
is so incredible about this is

3484
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:30,180
it's really just some straight
GPS lat-long times, and then

3485
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:32,500
from throwing it out directly at
the browser, we can create

3486
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:36,020
these pretty incredible,
dynamic, interactive tools,

3487
02:39:36,020 --> 02:39:39,330
rather than having to render
some preset tiles in advance,

3488
02:39:39,330 --> 02:39:40,920
and here's the story,
here's the map--

3489
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:42,900
which is great and fine, but
you can really start

3490
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:43,430
to play with it.

3491
02:39:43,430 --> 02:39:45,200
CHRIS BROADFOOT: The other thing
we didn't mention was

3492
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:49,180
we're using technologies like
Web Sockets to stream

3493
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:50,890
some the data down.

3494
02:39:50,890 --> 02:39:53,630
So like for the example where
I showed a small slice of

3495
02:39:53,630 --> 02:39:56,540
time, you can stream just that
data down to the client, they

3496
02:39:56,540 --> 02:40:00,700
can start looking at it in
hundreds of milliseconds as

3497
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:04,190
opposed to loading the
full data set.

3498
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:06,100
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

3499
02:40:06,100 --> 02:40:09,640
Or you could load just some
portion of the map that

3500
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:12,770
they're looking at, something
like that.

3501
02:40:12,770 --> 02:40:14,120
JOSH LIVNI: You want to
show the heat map?

3502
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:14,460
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

3503
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:18,370
So another visualization of this
data set, basically just

3504
02:40:18,370 --> 02:40:19,820
a heat map.

3505
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:22,940
So a heat map's really
an intensity map.

3506
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:27,140
So we can see the most-traveled
roads, which are

3507
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:29,700
in red, and it sort of
fades out to blue.

3508
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:34,750
And all of this being rendered
using WebGL as well, so it's

3509
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:38,150
quite fast. We've got 500,000
points here, I've just taken

3510
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:39,920
half of the data set.

3511
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:42,800
And you sort of see this really
blurry area around

3512
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:45,530
Market Street again, which
is interesting.

3513
02:40:45,530 --> 02:40:49,220
But this is a really good way
to see the most frequently

3514
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:50,790
traveled roads.

3515
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:53,520
And you sort of get a sense of
where they're stopping for

3516
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:57,260
traffic lights and taking off,
you sort of see a sort of

3517
02:40:57,260 --> 02:41:00,020
triangle pattern at
intersections, which I think

3518
02:41:00,020 --> 02:41:01,610
is interesting.

3519
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:02,710
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

3520
02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:05,200
And I think again, the main
story here is the problems

3521
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:07,260
that used to be really hard--
displaying a heat map, you had

3522
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:09,200
to set up all this
infrastructure, you had to get

3523
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,250
your points on top of the
geospatial database, you had

3524
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:12,830
to render some tiles, and
then boom, you have

3525
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:14,100
a static heat map.

3526
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:16,980
Now we can just get the raw data
and let users sort of see

3527
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:18,230
the story that they
want to see.

3528
02:41:18,230 --> 02:41:21,040
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You can start
to explore and look at what

3529
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:24,240
you want to look at.

3530
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:25,760
JOSH LIVNI: So I
think that's--

3531
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:26,510
oh yeah.

3532
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:28,190
What should you do if
you would like to do

3533
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:28,970
this type of thing?

3534
02:41:28,970 --> 02:41:30,430
So to kind of start out
at the beginning here,

3535
02:41:30,430 --> 02:41:32,670
just a quick recap.

3536
02:41:32,670 --> 02:41:34,900
Not all the way to Mayan style,
but if you want to

3537
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:37,932
start using some techniques to
make pretty maps, use our

3538
02:41:37,932 --> 02:41:39,850
Styled Maps, makes your
backgrounds, like you noticed

3539
02:41:39,850 --> 02:41:42,230
in these demos, a nice, faded
background lets you tell your

3540
02:41:42,230 --> 02:41:43,580
story nicely on top.

3541
02:41:43,580 --> 02:41:45,260
Maybe the story you have to
tell, you want some really

3542
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:46,790
vibrant colors, use
that beautiful

3543
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:47,910
example Chris put together.

3544
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:49,860
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I have a sweet
video of a Christmas

3545
02:41:49,860 --> 02:41:52,220
styled map, all green and red
and white, it's pretty sweet.

3546
02:41:52,220 --> 02:41:54,570
JOSH LIVNI: You can imagine how
pretty that would look.

3547
02:41:54,570 --> 02:41:56,440
Yeah, so the Style Map's really
good, use that for the

3548
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:57,595
background.

3549
02:41:57,595 --> 02:42:00,310
You've got some couple thousand
points, maybe you

3550
02:42:00,310 --> 02:42:03,400
want to cluster them, it's a
good technique, depending on

3551
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:06,670
the different stories you have.
Dotter, at Open Source

3552
02:42:06,670 --> 02:42:07,960
Library, you can look for.

3553
02:42:07,960 --> 02:42:10,580
That's just a canvas
[INAUDIBLE], so a lot of

3554
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:13,610
computers don't have WebGL
ready, maybe want to display a

3555
02:42:13,610 --> 02:42:17,300
few tens of thousands of points,
you get that in a nice

3556
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:21,310
canvas, it's widely supported
and looks pretty good.

3557
02:42:21,310 --> 02:42:25,000
Put your data up on some App
Engine, CloudSQL type of thing

3558
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:26,810
if you want, and then just
stream it down with web

3559
02:42:26,810 --> 02:42:29,740
sockets or what have you.

3560
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:33,150
You've got all the HTML5
stuff we covered.

3561
02:42:33,150 --> 02:42:35,450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So all of those
links are down at that

3562
02:42:35,450 --> 02:42:41,360
goo.gl short link, which will
also be on the next slide.

3563
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:42,430
Thanks for coming.

3564
02:42:42,430 --> 02:42:43,650
JOSH LIVNI: All right.

3565
02:42:43,650 --> 02:42:44,590
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And
drive safely.

3566
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:44,970
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, yeah.

3567
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:46,220
Indeed.

3568
02:42:46,220 --> 02:42:50,010

3569
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:51,655
So it looks like we
have about five,

3570
02:42:51,655 --> 02:42:52,620
seven minutes for questions?

3571
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:53,180
Is that right, Timothy?

3572
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:54,635
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You do have
time for questions.

3573
02:42:54,635 --> 02:42:55,170
JOSH LIVNI: That's what
I like to hear.

3574
02:42:55,170 --> 02:42:57,790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
many can we get?

3575
02:42:57,790 --> 02:42:58,120
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah?

3576
02:42:58,120 --> 02:42:59,250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I can
always rely on

3577
02:42:59,250 --> 02:43:00,860
this guy for a question.

3578
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:01,506
JOSH LIVNI: Uh oh.

3579
02:43:01,506 --> 02:43:02,240
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, cool.

3580
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:06,290
You mentioned kind of briefly
the limit between SVG and when

3581
02:43:06,290 --> 02:43:08,510
you started using WebGL.

3582
02:43:08,510 --> 02:43:11,020
I'd like to know more about
where that limit actually is,

3583
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:14,480
and then maybe even what, if
any, is the upper limit of

3584
02:43:14,480 --> 02:43:16,690
WebGL for the number of
points you can show.

3585
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:16,980
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yes.

3586
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:20,040
So we actually didn't do
anything with SVG, and I

3587
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:23,300
haven't done much work with SVG,
but I think for this kind

3588
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:26,645
of work, Canvas 2D is faster.

3589
02:43:26,645 --> 02:43:29,750
JOSH LIVNI: You tend to notice
a bit of a panning delay on

3590
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:32,210
the Redraw when you're working
with SVG, so it kind of

3591
02:43:32,210 --> 02:43:35,070
renders quickly and you have
instant CSS action on it,

3592
02:43:35,070 --> 02:43:39,130
which is great, but it has some
other drawbacks, and we

3593
02:43:39,130 --> 02:43:40,550
kind of prefer going with
the Canvas route.

3594
02:43:40,550 --> 02:43:43,880
But really important question,
which is how far can you get?

3595
02:43:43,880 --> 02:43:48,250
5,000, 10,000, 15,000, on
Canvas, and it really is up

3596
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:49,300
the person and their browser.

3597
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:50,760
CHRIS BROADFOOT: And
their computer.

3598
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:51,400
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, exactly.

3599
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:56,600
So most modern browsers, you
could get 20,000 points, no

3600
02:43:56,600 --> 02:43:58,540
problem probably on Canvas.

3601
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:02,450
But maybe an older browser,
you'd have some--

3602
02:44:02,450 --> 02:44:04,780
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So we actually
render Google Map

3603
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:08,530
Markers in Canvas, and we sort
of say tens of thousands on

3604
02:44:08,530 --> 02:44:12,250
modern browsers and on
non-modern, like thousands,

3605
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:13,140
something like that.

3606
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:14,170
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah.

3607
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:16,425
And that's really kind of the
same for WebGL, depends a

3608
02:44:16,425 --> 02:44:20,160
bunch on your hardware,
on your graphics card.

3609
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:22,400
The main limiting factor we've
noticed in WebGL is the

3610
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:23,910
bottleneck is kind of
the bandwidth to get

3611
02:44:23,910 --> 02:44:24,840
all the data over.

3612
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:26,130
And there's some interesting
things we're thinking

3613
02:44:26,130 --> 02:44:27,800
about to make that.

3614
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:30,550
So I didn't really show you this
part, but for example in

3615
02:44:30,550 --> 02:44:32,980
the fatality demo, there's
thousands of attributes that

3616
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:34,770
you can get all these
tables adjoined.

3617
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:37,670
A really simple API, you just
get only those attributes that

3618
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:40,520
I want and then bring
those ones over.

3619
02:44:40,520 --> 02:44:42,570
And so there's some techniques
you can use to overcome that

3620
02:44:42,570 --> 02:44:45,000
bottleneck, and the Web
Socket is just getting

3621
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,120
the subset you want.

3622
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:47,480
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So even though
you can bring big data

3623
02:44:47,480 --> 02:44:49,980
into the client, you might
not necessarily want

3624
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:51,920
to take all of it.

3625
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:55,920
There's definitely a case
for taking slices of it.

3626
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,840
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah but definitely,
a million plus

3627
02:44:57,840 --> 02:44:59,100
points we've been showing,
and pretty

3628
02:44:59,100 --> 02:45:02,145
snappy, no problem here.

3629
02:45:02,145 --> 02:45:03,440
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Heat maps
are pretty intensive

3630
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:05,222
to generate as well.

3631
02:45:05,222 --> 02:45:07,320
So it's cool stuff.

3632
02:45:07,320 --> 02:45:09,564
Yep, down here?

3633
02:45:09,564 --> 02:45:11,910
MALE SPEAKER: I was just
wondering if the API will

3634
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:15,750
include a fallback for less
modern browsers for those

3635
02:45:15,750 --> 02:45:18,310
features, like for
WebGL and Canvas?

3636
02:45:18,310 --> 02:45:18,556
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Right.

3637
02:45:18,556 --> 02:45:21,280
So everything we've shown here
isn't in the API itself, it's

3638
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:24,560
just sort of our experiments.

3639
02:45:24,560 --> 02:45:28,140
JOSH LIVNI: So as a developer,
you would potentially check to

3640
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:30,310
see if the person had WebGL,
if so, give them one

3641
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:33,040
experience, and kind of have
your own series of fall-backs,

3642
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:35,870
a pretty good technique
to have generally.

3643
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:37,100
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

3644
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:37,810
JOSH LIVNI: Yes, exactly.

3645
02:45:37,810 --> 02:45:39,580
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So maybe if
they don't have WebGL, you

3646
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:42,610
don't have these cool sliders,
you just give them the tiles

3647
02:45:42,610 --> 02:45:45,480
to look at.

3648
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:49,000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Additional
questions?

3649
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:53,050
MALE SPEAKER: This might be a
little bit of a segue, but so

3650
02:45:53,050 --> 02:45:55,140
I saw you guys did a lot of
stuff on the map itself, but

3651
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:57,980
one of the pain points that
I found is the map bubble.

3652
02:45:57,980 --> 02:46:01,450
Were there any developments made
in making it easier for

3653
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:04,060
developers to customize
the map bubble itself?

3654
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:04,470
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

3655
02:46:04,470 --> 02:46:07,420
There's a couple Open Source
libraries that sort of

3656
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:09,920
re-implement a nice-looking
bubble.

3657
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:12,280
Info Bubble's one of them
that's really, really

3658
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:13,046
customizable.

3659
02:46:13,046 --> 02:46:15,060
You can use CSS to style it.

3660
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:18,090
Yeah, check that out.

3661
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:19,340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: More
questions?

3662
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:22,130

3663
02:46:22,130 --> 02:46:24,130
No?

3664
02:46:24,130 --> 02:46:24,760
Is that it?

3665
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:25,552
All right.

3666
02:46:25,552 --> 02:46:29,600
Is there anything else you guys
want to say before we go?

3667
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:29,790
JOSH LIVNI: No.

3668
02:46:29,790 --> 02:46:31,600
We'll be around here for a
little while if you want to

3669
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:34,440
come up and chat.

3670
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:37,195
Drive home safe, and
play with WebGL.

3671
02:46:37,195 --> 02:46:38,020
Thanks, guys.

3672
02:46:38,020 --> 02:46:42,050
[APPLAUSE]

3673
02:46:42,050 --> 02:46:42,380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

3674
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:44,560
So just a few announcements for
you before we get going.

3675
02:46:44,560 --> 02:46:46,590
Thank you, of course, to all
of our speakers for the

3676
02:46:46,590 --> 02:46:48,590
excellent material that
they presented.

3677
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:51,530
I'd also like to thank NewTek
for bringing in that really

3678
02:46:51,530 --> 02:46:54,200
cool tri-caster rig and
making our web stream

3679
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:55,950
look absolutely fantastic.

3680
02:46:55,950 --> 02:46:59,160
We do have a hot dog
cart out front.

3681
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:02,030
So if you're hungry, please
do grab some food.

3682
02:47:02,030 --> 02:47:03,510
We also have--

3683
02:47:03,510 --> 02:47:04,060
what's that?

3684
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:04,790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry
to the live stream.

3685
02:47:04,790 --> 02:47:05,900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, sorry
to the live stream.

3686
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:07,610
No hot dogs for you.

3687
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:11,320
We do have code labs later
today, so please be sure to

3688
02:47:11,320 --> 02:47:12,630
check out that event's URL.

3689
02:47:12,630 --> 02:47:15,070
Just search for South by
Southwest Google, and you'll

3690
02:47:15,070 --> 02:47:18,410
get to our events URL with
speakers, where we're speaking

3691
02:47:18,410 --> 02:47:19,810
all around South By.

3692
02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:21,740
And also, come back for
these code labs.

3693
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:24,130
It's a really great chance
to get sort of one-on-one

3694
02:47:24,130 --> 02:47:27,050
attention to do some cool
stuff with the APIs.

3695
02:47:27,050 --> 02:47:29,830
And those are at 3:00
PM in this house.

3696
02:47:29,830 --> 02:47:31,510
Anything else?

3697
02:47:31,510 --> 02:47:32,830
I have cue cards.

3698
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:34,080
They're human cue cards.

3699
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:35,125
It's really great.

3700
02:47:35,125 --> 02:47:38,040
But thank you so much and have
a great time at South By, and

3701
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:39,590
do try and stay dry.

3702
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:40,840
Bye now.

3703
02:47:40,840 --> 02:48:59,696
