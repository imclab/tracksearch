1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,346

2
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:06,150
SPEAKER 1: Sean, hi.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,670
GDG is a very interesting
development community.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,006
SPEAKER 2: I'm glad somebody
has asked this question.

5
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:12,960
SPEAKER 3: This is where
the magic happens.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,790
SPEAKER 4: This is primarily
a question and answer show.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,105
So if any of you would like
to ask questions.

8
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:23,680

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,460
CLAUDIO: Hi, everyone.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,920
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,590
My name is Claudio
and this is Vic.

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,910
We are two engineers in the
Google Drive SDK team.

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,920
Today we're going to review on
an app that is on the Chrome

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,990
Web Store and that integrates
with Google Drive.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,700
We decided for today we wanted
to show something that might

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,330
be useful for students
going back to school.

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,900
So what is this app, Vic?

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,760
VIC: So the app is called the
Desmos Graphing Calculator.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,410
And it's a very popular app
in the Chrome Web Store.

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,830
I have their homepage
open here.

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,180
And we can just take a look
through the core application.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,040
So essentially what it allows
you to do is write a series of

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,850
equations that come up with a
graphical representation.

24
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,470
So if we scroll down here,
here's some recent graphs that

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,930
people have made.

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,900
Here's Batman.

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,800
So somebody wrote some
equations that

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,940
created a bat symbol.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,350
CLAUDIO: How does that
help with school?

30
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,960
VIC: Well learning must
be fun, right?

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,780
CLAUDIO: OK.

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,210
VIC: So if you create Batman,
you'll probably learn a lot

33
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,310
about these equations
because these

34
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,320
are not trivial equations.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,760
There's some other ones
here that are a

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,140
little bit more relevant.

37
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,660
So here's a couple of waves
and linear equations.

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,010
So essentially this application
is targeted at

39
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,060
anybody who needs to make graphs
very often, which, I

40
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,460
think, is largely students
working on classes.

41
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,110
So this is an app that
integrates with Google Drive

42
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,820
by the Chrome Web Store.

43
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,260
So to take a look today at this
app and then review it,

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,390
we're going to install it from
the Chrome web store.

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,770
So here I am in Drive, and I'm
going to get more apps.

46
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,580

47
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,850
And then when the Chrome Web
Store comes up, we're going to

48
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,605
see all of the Google
Drive apps.

49
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,610
CLAUDIO:So when you click on Get
More Apps, you're brought

50
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,110
to a specific collection inside
the Chrome Web Store

51
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,130
where you can see all the
applications that integrate

52
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,910
with Drive?

53
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,090
VIC: Yeah, so there's a lot.

54
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,290
But the one that we're looking
for today is Desmos Graphing

55
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,930
Calculator, which
is right here.

56
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:32,200
So if you click Add to Chrome,
this is going to install it.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,850
Here we see that it came up in
the Chrome New Tab page.

58
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,460
I'm going to come back to Drive,
and we'll be able to

59
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,810
create more Graphing Calculator
by Desmos.

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,630
So if I create this, the first
thing that we have to do is

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,340
authorize the application, and
tell it that it can create

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,360
graph files on our behalf,
and store them in Drive.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,615
So we're going to
allow access.

64
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:04,460

65
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,830
And then, finally, we're
taken into Desmos.

66
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,980
So here the graph is
currently empty

67
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,890
because we have no equations.

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,035
But if I enter some equations
here, like here's one for a

69
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:19,820
circle, it graphs instantly.

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,810
And we can add more equations,
like x plus y equals 2 just

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,900
for a line.

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,060
So we could continue doing
this, and then save it to

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,490
Desmos or to Drive.

74
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,330
So here if we click Save, it's
asking us to create a new

75
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,320
account or to log in.

76
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,290
VIC: This is a new account
on Desmos, right?

77
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,560
This is not a Google account.

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,850
VIC: Yeah.

79
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,020
The one difference is
that we can sign in

80
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,420
with OpenID on Google.

81
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,830
And then you'll notice it asks
us to authorize again.

82
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,100
And we come back, and now we're

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,400
actually saving the graph.

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,240
So we'll say line and circle.

85
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,980
And we'll just share it with
the world for now and click

86
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,980
Save Graph.

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,662
So here we get a permalink and
some ways to share it.

88
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,290
Take me back to my graph.

89
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,430
So one of the advantages of this
application is that you

90
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,000
can instantaneously graph pretty
much any equation.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,829
It's very, very powerful
for students.

92
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,970
CLAUDIO: And you can also start
from someone else's

93
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,910
graph, and see how that
translates into equations.

94
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,120
Maybe it's very hard to
understand, at least for me.

95
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
But for some people, this can
be very, very easy to

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,850
understand.

97
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,860
And you can easily move back and
forth equation to graph.

98
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,810
Can you also edit it?

99
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,150
VIC: Yeah.

100
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,540
So here I could create a new
expression on this graph.

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,340
And then x squared
plus y squared--

102
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,070
CLAUDIO: So you can start from
someone else's equation and

103
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,707
extend it or change it?

104
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:48,681
VIC: Yeah.

105
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:54,680
So if we do that, then
it really is good for

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,730
collaboration between students
and teachers.

107
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,960
So here, maybe a teacher creates
a template graph and

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,370
then asks students to add some
equations that will intersect

109
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,930
certain points, or something
like that.

110
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,310
So super powerful app.

111
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,440
There's also a keypad, and
there's some other additional

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,810
settings that you can do to
customize the graphs.

113
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,280
Like you can change the labels
on each of the axes

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,480
and things like that.

115
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,930
So we're very pleased with
the core application.

116
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,670
What we were going to talk
about today is how they

117
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,400
integrate with Drive and what
they could do better or what

118
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,180
they already do well.

119
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,830
CLAUDIO: OK.

120
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,450
I think we can start from the
authorization mechanism.

121
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,440
VIC: Yeah.

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,500
So when a user originates in
Drive, they create more

123
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,170
Graphing Calculator by Desmos.

124
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,960
One of the problems is that
Desmos currently is not

125
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,640
automatically logging the
user in when they

126
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,020
originate from Drive.

127
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,730
And this is a problem because it
causes the user to have to

128
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,460
log in twice.

129
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,578
So here, actually, if I log out,
we can demonstrate this a

130
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:05,120
little bit more easily.

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,700
So if I create another graph.

132
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,770

133
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,450
The user should arrive at the
application logged in.

134
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,170
But you can see that we're
not logged in.

135
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,100
So this is one convenience
mechanism for users

136
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,770
originating from Drive.

137
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,770
Also, if the user originates
from Drive, there's no way to

138
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,150
actually save back to
Drive at the moment.

139
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,230
So I believe that this is
something that Desmos used to

140
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,490
support but removed temporarily
because of some

141
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,240
integration issues between
Desmos and Google Drive.

142
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,610
I think that those are issues
we've since resolved.

143
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,650
And so we're really looking
forward to Desmos bringing

144
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,570
this functionality back.

145
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,620
CLAUDIO: So what should be the
best flow for the user?

146
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,780
VIC: Ideally the best flow for
the user is creating a graph

147
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,380
from within Google Drive.

148
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,770
And when they land here,
they are logged in.

149
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,700
And they create some
graph like this.

150
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,000
And when they click Save,
instead of requiring the user

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,970
to log in again, or create a
Desmos account, instead of

152
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,240
walking through this flow, where
I have to authorize a

153
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,060
second time, and then do this
to save my graph, everything

154
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,900
is saved into Drive
automatically.

155
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,610
CLAUDIO: But right
now it's not.

156
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:25,810
VIC: Right.

157
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,010
Right now, nothing has been
saved into Drive.

158
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,910
In fact, if we look at all
of the files on this test

159
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,810
account, we can see that there's
just nothing here.

160
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,020
So Desmos is saving the graph
locally within Desmos.

161
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,050
So their Drive integration is
missing some key components

162
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,240
right now, primarily the ability
to create and store

163
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,680
graphs within Drive.

164
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,410
They are also missing the
component to open certain

165
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,510
graphing files from within
Drive, which is fine.

166
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,090
But if they were storing native
Desmos graphs in Drive,

167
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,880
then those should be open.

168
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,030
CLAUDIO: But they can
also store some

169
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,350
shortcuts to documents.

170
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,360
Store them there on
their server.

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,430
So it depends on their
implementation.

172
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,250
But one thing you can do as a
developer is that you can

173
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,960
still store all the data in your
back end, whatever that

174
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,190
is, a database, a local file
system, it doesn't matter.

175
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,260
But you can have shortcuts,
links, or pointers to those

176
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,640
documents from Google Drive.

177
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,550
And this is not happening
at the moment.

178
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,620
VIC: That's exactly right.

179
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,460
So it doesn't matter really
if they store this

180
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,220
data in Drive or not.

181
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,980
They could store it on
Desmos.com but link to it with

182
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,409
a shortcut file from
within Drive.

183
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,169

184
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,420
We need to make it clear,
though, that Desmos is a

185
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,940
perfect use case for integrating
like this with

186
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,910
Google Drive.

187
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,490
Here they have a single document
interface that's

188
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,670
working on a single
file at a time.

189
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,145
And if that file was stored in
Drive or a shortcut was stored

190
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:03,680
in Drive, then it would add the
ability for more users to

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,510
interact with these things
more quickly,

192
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,420
which is pretty important.

193
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,920
Also, integrating with Drive
gets you things like sharing

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,030
for free, it gets you searching
for free, and things

195
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,430
like this, and it allows users
to collaborate on these

196
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,920
documents a little
bit more quickly.

197
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,940
CLAUDIO: Yeah, there's also
something else they can do to

198
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,760
make the user experience better,
integrating better

199
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,740
with Google Drive.

200
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,830
I see there's a button that
says My Graphs on

201
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,070
the top left corner.

202
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,590
What does that do?

203
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,180
VIC: It shows all of your
graphs saved in Desmos.

204
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,680
CLAUDIO: They can probably
integrate this with Google

205
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Drive, and show all the files
you have, all the matching

206
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,410
files you have, on
Google Drive.

207
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,760
And if developers want
to integrate with--

208
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,770
when I have a dialog
to pick files from

209
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,250
Drive, we provide that.

210
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,730
It's called Google Picker API.

211
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,540
It's part of the Google
Drive SDK.

212
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,480
It's a JavaScript
API you can use.

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,270
You can easily integrate it into
your application, and use

214
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,570
it to show the lists of files
from the user's account that

215
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,670
match some specific criteria.

216
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,240
VIC: Exactly.

217
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,000
So if we go to the Drive
SDK documentation at

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,300
developers.Google.com/drive
somewhere here, I think it's--

219
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,322
CLAUDIO: Manage Drive Files.

220
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,590
VIC:Yep.

221
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,836
And then actually, no.

222
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,086
I don't think it's there.

223
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:33,440

224
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
CLAUDIO: Integrate with Drive.

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,240
VIC: Yeah.

226
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,690
Sorry, we'll just rework
this a little bit.

227
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,160
So if we open files--

228
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,710

229
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,710
CLAUDIO: So there are
different ways

230
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,650
you can open files.

231
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,310
The first one we saw is that you
click on a file on Drive

232
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,190
UI or you create a new one,
and that saves it.

233
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,780
But, as a side, you could
also use a Picker.

234
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,070
VIC: Yeah.

235
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,405
So here's the documentation
about how to use the Google

236
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,060
Drive Picker.

237
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,920
And, essentially, how to embed
something contextually into

238
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,840
the page of your application
that will show essentially the

239
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,760
Google Drive dialog box that
allows you to choose files

240
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,990
from within Google Drive.

241
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,150
So you can see it's actually
pretty quick

242
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,020
and simple to implement.

243
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,360
In Desmos' case, they may have
a strong opinion that they

244
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,820
want users only choosing files
from within Desmos.

245
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,310
And that's fine.

246
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,890
A Drive SDK integration
is not all or nothing.

247
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,590
This is just another suggestion
that would make

248
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:32,330
their app easier to use from
a Drive user's perspective.

249
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,890
CLAUDIO: And just about
something while we mentioned

250
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,330
the Picker The Picker can be
used to select files from

251
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,420
Drive, but it can also be used
to upload files from Drive.

252
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,840
So let's say if you have a
client-side application or you

253
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,220
want the users to upload files,
you can just use the

254
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,870
same Picker that you use for
downloading to upload.

255
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,350
Maybe this is not the
case for Desmos.

256
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,830
I don't think they have to
upload files to Drive.

257
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,190
But it might be good to know.

258
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,436
VIC: Exactly.

259
00:11:59,436 --> 00:11:59,810
Yeah.

260
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,870
So can you think of any other
ways that Desmos could

261
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,770
integrate with Drive?

262
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,400
CLAUDIO: I think the most
confusing part is just the

263
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,320
authentication and the login,
the user creation, which is

264
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,140
not clear for users.

265
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,860
What a Desmos account is, and
what a Google account is.

266
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,780
I mean, you think you're logged
in into Google, and you

267
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,670
are, and you're not logged
into Desmos.

268
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,320
Or you can be logged into
Desmos, but not

269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,770
logged in into Google.

270
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,690
And this has to be as defined
as possible to the users so

271
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,570
that they log in once
and that's it.

272
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,170
And that's why we want
developers to use OpenID,

273
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,930
which is the technology that
allows you to delegate

274
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,460
authentication to Google.

275
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,700
VIC: So other apps get around
this in that if, for instance,

276
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,620
another application needed to
make a native account, they

277
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,280
would automatically create the
native account and associate

278
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,860
the incoming Google user
with that account.

279
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,390
So when the user arrives from
Drive, Drive also sends a

280
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,560
token along.

281
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,130
And the application should be
using this token to gain

282
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,320
access to a user's Drive
files when they arrive.

283
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,330
Because the user, after
they've installed the

284
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,730
application and run it from
within Drive, has already

285
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,030
authorized the app to access
certain files.

286
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,010
So that could be a little bit
cleaned up so that when I come

287
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,030
here and I create more Graphing
Calculator, I land

288
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,420
here, I'm signed in, and when
I save the file, it

289
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,350
automatically goes back to Drive
because that's where I

290
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,110
originated from anyway.

291
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,600
CLAUDIO: And another suggestion
I might have, it

292
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,800
depends on what is the file
format they use to store their

293
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,630
data on Drive.

294
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,080
So regardless if they have
only a shortcut to their

295
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,090
document somewhere else, or if
they store everything on

296
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,110
Drive, this can probably be
easily translated into some

297
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,680
XML file, or something like
that, some kind of text files.

298
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,500
Something they can do to make it
easier for Google to index

299
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,900
the text content so that it
can be easier for users to

300
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,600
find a document.

301
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,670
So whenever you create an
equation, but when you save

302
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,580
it, I think you could also add
some description fields, some

303
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,830
tags, or something like that.

304
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,970
So if that is a text file, then
Google will automatically

305
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,090
index that text so that users
can find it by searching for

306
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,100
some terms.

307
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,940
But if there is a binary format,
we don't have a way to

308
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,830
find out what the text is.

309
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,380
VIC: Currently within
Desmos, yeah.

310
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,810
CLAUDIO: Yeah.

311
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,600
And developers can provide some
indexable tags for us.

312
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,640
So there is this field in the
API that they can use so that

313
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,310
even if we don't know what the
file format is, and we don't

314
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,100
know how to open a specific
file, or read what the text

315
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,000
content is, you can still
provide us with some text

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,060
content, and we will index it
and we will treat it exactly

317
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,560
the same way as we treat
the text we index.

318
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,260
VIC:Yeah, exactly.

319
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,000
So when creating or updating a
file, applications can set the

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,390
indexable text, which is here.

321
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,680
So, like Claudio said, it's just
a field of keywords, a

322
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,520
normal text field.

323
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,750
And you set whatever keywords
you'd like Google to index on.

324
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,590
And then when the user searches
for something in

325
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,700
Google Drive, if one of those
keywords matches,

326
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,340
then we show the file.

327
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,580
CLAUDIO: One of the things to
mention about the indexable

328
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,690
text field is that field
is write only.

329
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,090
And you have to provide a new
indexable text field every

330
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,120
time you update the document
because, of course, if you

331
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,280
changed the content of your
document, you have to change

332
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,160
the indexable text
accordingly.

333
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,310
And if you don't provide a new
indexable text when you update

334
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,800
an existing file, we will assume
you just want to clear

335
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,020
that field, so we will store
an empty indexable text.

336
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,140
VIC: So this is a future request
that we've gotten is

337
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,840
to make the indexable text
readable by applications, and

338
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,790
it's something we're
considering.

339
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,870
So getting back to Desmos,
this is a really, really

340
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,020
powerful application that we
highly recommend you use.

341
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,580
Go to the Chrome Web Store,
install Desmos Graphing

342
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,030
Calculator.

343
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,420
It's very powerful.

344
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,130
I actually use it somewhat
often now that

345
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,410
I've discovered it.

346
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,630
It's very, very convenient for
just drawing graphs of

347
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,500
equations, which we do often.

348
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,160
CLAUDIO: Just to, before we wrap
up, so you showed how to

349
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,800
get to the Chrome Web Store
when you start from Drive.

350
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,180
And that is really easy.

351
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,530
So you said you wanted
to create something.

352
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,470
You don't have an application,
so you do more, and

353
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,110
you get more apps.

354
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,140
And this will land you
directly to the Drive

355
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,350
application collection.

356
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,260
What if you start from the
Web Store directly?

357
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,620
How do you find this collection
inside Drive?

358
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,330
VIC: That's a good point.

359
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,420
CLAUDIO: The Web Store.

360
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,560
VIC: So if we just land in the
normal Chrome Web Store, this

361
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,150
is what it looks like.

362
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,349
You can see various types
of applications here.

363
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,439
If you want to see all of the
Google Drive applications,

364
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,980
just go to Collections and
then Google Drive.

365
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,069
And then here you can see all
of the apps that have some

366
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,150
integration with Google Drive.

367
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,810
So there's a lot.

368
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,480
We recommend you just take
a look through them.

369
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,339
There's a bunch of image
editors, presentation editors,

370
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:30,130
there's AutoCAD WS, if you
work with CAD documents.

371
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,380
CLAUDIO: And also to make it
easy to recognize Google Drive

372
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,910
applications, we added a
small logo, 2H listing.

373
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,560
So that is the Google
Drive logo on the

374
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,600
bottom right corner.

375
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,240
And if you click on one of those
listings, you will see

376
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,070
that it works with Google
Drive, which is

377
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,200
our badge for it.

378
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,620
VIC: Exactly.

379
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,460
Yep.

380
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,710
CLAUDIO: And, of course, as in
all applications in the Chrome

381
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,410
Web Store, you can read reviews
from other users.

382
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,530
You can see star rating,
and so on.

383
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,880
VIC: Yeah, so here's the
listing for Desmos.

384
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,426
You can see they have 142
five-star reviews.

385
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:12,380
So if we go into the reviews,
you can see this first review

386
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,110
here from a Google user,
"Nothing short of amazing.

387
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,260
Best thing out there.

388
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,100
It's so good.

389
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,160
I've never seen such a perfect
graphing calculator."

390
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,300
CLAUDIO: Yeah, it's an
amazing application.

391
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,660
VIC: Great application.

392
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,530
CLAUDIO: You should try it.

393
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:24,860
VIC: All right.

394
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,720
So that about wraps
it up for today's

395
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,860
Google Developers Live.

396
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,746
We have reviewed Desmos
Graphing Calculator.

397
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:31,610
CLAUDIO: See you next week.

398
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,860
Thank you very much.

399
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:47,333
