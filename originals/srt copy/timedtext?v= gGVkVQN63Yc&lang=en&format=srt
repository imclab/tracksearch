1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
>> KAY: So, let's show you this how easy it
is to write an extension. We’re going to

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,130
build one live in front of you in the next
couple of minutes here. And it's not just

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,240
going to be a “Hello World” extension.
It's going to be something that actually does

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,450
something real. In fact, it's been a pretty
frequently requested feature in the browser

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,180
itself. We're going to build an extension
that allows you to email the page that you're

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,700
on to somebody else. So, just to show that
this is live and whatever, could somebody

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,770
give me the name of a small mammal? Anybody?
>> Gopher.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,609
>> KAY: Gopher. Okay, a gopher. So, we're
going to name this extension a gopher. And

9
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:41,039
the way--so, what we're going to do is we're
going start by creating a manifest file.

10
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:48,039
>> BOODMAN: I think it’s spelled that way.
>> KAY: So, when we first started creating

11
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:50,699
the extension, we create a directory and we
create a file on that called the manifest

12
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:57,309
file. The manifest file is just a simple JSON
file that has some key value pairs in it.

13
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:01,960
One of them is the name. I might have a version,
a description. This is sort of the basic building

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,070
blocks sort of to find what an extension is.
For this particular extension, we're going

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,990
to use a bit of functionality called the browser
action. Now, a browser action is just a little

16
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,170
button that shows up in the toolbar of the
browser. And it has a whole bunch of different

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:21,719
options, but for now, all we're going to set
is the icon and the title of it. So, Aaron's

18
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,450
got an image already made that we're going
to grab for it, and the title will set something

19
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,450
that matches our animal here, I guess. Right.
I don't know what the sound a gopher makes.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,090
They back, could be. So, let's go get that
image and copy it into the folder.

21
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,590
>> BOODMAN: Okay.
>> KAY: So, as I said, they're just collections

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,479
of Web pages and their resources, so they
just sort of live next to each other just

23
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,750
like they would on a Web server, but we’re
making this packet. So now, believe it or

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,640
not, we’ve got actually an extension that's
going to do something in the browser. So,

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,009
let's load it up. So, the way to do that is
we go into the browser and go to the launch

26
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,359
menu and extensions. So, this will take you
to the extensions management page. There's

27
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,259
a developer mode that you can turn on. And
from there, there's an option called load

28
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,370
unpacked extensions. This just says, “I'm
going to load a directory as if it were a

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,150
fully ready to go extension.” So, we load
our gopher extension and boom. Right there,

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,030
you see the new icon shows up in the toolbar
immediately, and has the little text that

31
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,170
he specified there. Okay. But, if he clicks
on it, it doesn't do anything. So now, it's

32
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,170
time to actually hook it up and make it do
something real, okay? So to do that, the next

33
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,640
step is to add something called the background
page. Now, background page is just an HTML

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,379
page, but it's not visible to the user. It's
hidden in the background but it's loaded when

35
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:52,470
the browser starts up and it's always running.
So, that's usually where people put the meat

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,549
of their extension launching. So, as I said,
it’s just a basic HTML page where I put

37
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,530
some script in there. And what the script
is going to do, it’s going to add an event

38
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,890
listener to the browser action button. And
that event listener is going to have a little

39
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,939
callback in it. And when it gets called, he's
going to call a window that open, bring up

40
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:16,939
a pop-up, and send to a Gmail URL, we’re
going to get in a minute here, and so we can

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,420
send that mail. Those of you who are Web programmers
in the audience now, there's a lot of options

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,719
to hear. So, we'll wait for Aaron to get them
all typed in?

43
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,000
>> BOODMAN: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I can't remember
the URLs, so I'm going to copy it someplace

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
else. I'm not good in remembering long random
URLs.

45
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,930
>> KAY: But, I am.
>> BOODMAN: So it’s easy to catch wherever

46
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,549
they set Webs.
>> KAY: So anyways, believe it or not, now

47
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,829
we’ve got an extension. We're ready to go.
So, let’s see if it actually does something.

48
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,780
So, the way we do this is we go to the management
page and we hit “reload,” just like you

49
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,370
would on a Web page. Now, a whole extension
reloads and the functionality is ready to

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,540
go. So, if you go to the Google page, we're
going to share that with somebody, click on

51
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,540
it. Nothing happened. Okay, live demo. So,
it's probably a bug. Let's find out, the good

52
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,469
thing another one...
>> BOODMAN: So unconvincing.

53
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:18,340
>> KAY: Yeah, so unconvincing. No one believes
that that was actually an accidental bug.

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:25,340
Okay. Well, okay. So, let's find the bug anyway.
Just play along with us here. So, when you're

55
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,590
doing--as I said before, you get to use all
same developer tools that you would use for

56
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,280
normal Web pages. And we got really powerful
once with the WebKit’s Web Inspector. You

57
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,889
can see the “inspect back active views”
on that page. Just click on it and brought

58
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,720
up the Web Inspector. The Web inspector has
a ton of powerful features. You can inspect

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,080
the DOM, manage CSS. You can look at all the
resources that this loaded. You can use the

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,940
active script debugger and set breakpoints.
You can look at the timeline if you want some

61
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,870
to measure performance and see what's going
where, or go to the CPU Profilers and Heap

62
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,720
Profilers. This is a really simple extension,
though. So, all we're going to do is notice

63
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,220
that there's a little red error indicator
in the corner. He is going to click on that.

64
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,490
And it's going to tell us what our error was.
It says that this object has no method name

65
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,090
to add. So, apparently we got the method name
wrong. So, let's find out what the method

66
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,780
name really should have been. What Aaron is
showing you here is auto-complete in a console.

67
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,970
The console has access to all of the objects
that are there and can show you what's there.

68
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,910
So, Chrome.browserx on click and it’s “add
a listener” not “add,” yeah, exactly.

69
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,669
So, good catch up. So for the person who caught
that in the audience and knew that we were

70
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:40,669
faking here, so, good job. So, we'll change
that to “add listener.” And now, we reload

71
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:50,509
the extension. And let's try out on that page.
There is the window. Oh...

72
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,830
>> BOODMAN: I forgot to...
>> KAY: Yeah, yeah. I think we forgot the

73
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,050
feature there, but let's add that URL back
in. Can we do that?

74
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,690
>> BOODMAN: Okay.
>> KAY: So, we can actually get this listener

75
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,050
that gets the--gets the Tab passed into it.
So, you forgot a plus there, I think.

76
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,380
>> BOODMAN: Oh, yeah.
>> KAY: And so, we can attach that into the

77
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,990
body. So it's actually going to mail the URL
to the page that we’re on. So, quick fix

78
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,319
that.
>> BOODMAN: Oh, I nailed it. This demo is

79
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,800
going awesomely.
>> KAY: Yes. Here we go. Here we go. So now

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,780
we have the working mail of this page extension.
So, we'll send it to ourselves, and then we're

81
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,110
done. But actually even though we got a functioning
extension, we’re not quite done yet. The

82
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,490
next step is we'd like to share with our friends.
So, the best way to do that is on the Chrome

83
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:48,509
Extensions gallery. So, let's go and see if
we can upload that to the gallery. So, you

84
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,330
hit to the developer section of the Chrome
Extensions gallery, and you say, “Add new

85
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,449
item.” And this guy will tell you, he wants
a Zip file. A zip, you know, just package

86
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,830
up the directory as a single Zip file. So,
let's just do that quickly here. And then,

87
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,830
upload it directly. And when that's all done,
we're going to get to set some properties

88
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,090
that are going--about how it's going to appear
in the gallery. But I bet a bunch of you have

89
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,650
already done this, so not too big of a surprise
but a short little upload. And right now,

90
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,629
while it’s waiting here, so it may seem
like it's taking a little bit longer than

91
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:28,349
you'd think for a small file. But it's actually
doing a little bit of work on the backend,

92
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:35,039
verifying there are no errors and checking
to make sure that things are going. So, hello,

93
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,840
excellent, perfect there. So now, we get to
the landing page and here is where you can

94
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,470
add a little more detail about what's going
to show up in the landing page when people

95
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,039
find your extension in the gallery. So, a
detailed description links to your Website.

96
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,020
You can upload screenshots linked to YouTube
videos, so that people can see screen casts

97
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,650
of your extension in action. We think this
is going to be a really compelling feature

98
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,740
and we'll show you a little bit more of that
in action later. So then when we're done,

99
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,270
we publish the extension and it will take
a second as it's going through. And there

100
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,819
you go, the extension is now live in the gallery,
and we're done. So, live extension, less than

101
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:19,879
five minutes, I think. And, well, all in all
pretty easy and pretty fast.
