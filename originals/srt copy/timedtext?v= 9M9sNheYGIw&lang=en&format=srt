1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,200
Schroepfer: Hi, folks.
Hey, up here.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,968
You guys over here,
if you want to see the panel,

3
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:06,634
you can move down this way.

4
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:08,567
Otherwise, enjoy your laptops
on that side.

5
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,467
Welcome to the Browser
Perspective panels.

6
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:11,734
I'm Mike Schroepfer.

7
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,667
I am your moderator
for today.

8
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,400
We've got three
great panelists here

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,701
representing a variety
of viewpoints

10
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,467
on where browsers are going.

11
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,501
We've got Charles,
who's been working on standards

12
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,767
for about ten years.

13
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,434
For the last four years
he's been working

14
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,267
with Opera software.

15
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,767
Part of the W3C.

16
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,434
Part of many of the emerging
web standards.

17
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,200
Let's welcome Charles
to the panel.

18
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,834
Yay.
[applause]

19
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,634
Boo?
Charles: [laughter]

20
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:36,701
Schroepfer:
Save that for later.

21
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,367
Next to Charles
we have Jonas.

22
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,968
Jonas has also been working
for for browser technologies

23
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,434
for about ten years,

24
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:44,334
first as a Mozilla
community member,

25
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:46,133
and now as a--
the last several years

26
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,400
as a full-time
Mozilla developer.

27
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,767
Been concentrating
in the DOM,

28
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,767
and also a participant
in many W3C working groups.

29
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:57,534
Welcome, Jonas.
[applause]

30
00:00:57,534 --> 00:01:00,467
And Ian is a product manager
on Google Chrome.

31
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,534
He's been with the team
since 2007.

32
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:05,100
He works on core infrastructure,
security,

33
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,701
and focuses a lot of his time
on HTML 5

34
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,000
and emerging web standards,

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,601
and has been
an active participant, again,

36
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,868
in the web standards
working group.

37
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,467
So welcome to our panel, Ian.

38
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:17,934
[applause]

39
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:18,934
All right,
so I'd like to kick it off

40
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,334
with a couple of questions,

41
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,601
and then we'll definitely
open it up to the audience

42
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:24,767
to see what things
you are curious about.

43
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,200
Start with you, Charles.

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,234
I'm curious as to
what you think

45
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,734
the most promising emerging
standard is on the market,

46
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:32,234
and why you're excited
by it.

47
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:34,033
Charles: Uh,
that's a tough question.

48
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,033
I think one of the things
that I'm really excited by--

49
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:40,934
Doug wants me to say SVG,
which is what I was gonna say.

50
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,000
But I think that's
pretty much emerged,

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,567
and, you know,
it's out of the closet.

52
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,667
The access to device
information--

53
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:52,334
the location, the camera,
the SMS,

54
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:54,467
the address book stuff.

55
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,200
And the reason I'm really,
really excited about it is

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,734
because it makes us
get security right.

57
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:02,267
So like, if you start
telling the web

58
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:05,934
where people are
and who they talk to

59
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,667
and what their device does,

60
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,801
you've gotta
get security right

61
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:12,100
in a way that we've
never really done before.

62
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,400
And doing that means
we can really go out

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,534
and make cool things
and let 'em run.

64
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,501
So I think that's probably
one of the most exciting things

65
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,834
happening right now.

66
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,167
Schroepfer: So, Jonas,
if you could make

67
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,000
every other browser vendor
implement one standard today,

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,767
what standard would that be?

69
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:34,767
Jonas: Uh, I would probably say
one of the things

70
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,868
I would really like to see
is OGG support

71
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:40,067
for the video tag.

72
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,501
Having free video
on the web is--

73
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,133
[applause]

74
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,100
It's very, very important.

75
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,901
And it's also a standard where
we don't yet have--

76
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,868
Everyone is behind
the video tag,

77
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,367
and that's very good.

78
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:57,167
Making it easier for people
to put video on the web

79
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:00,234
without relying on things
like Vimeo or YouTube

80
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,467
is really good.

81
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,234
But also having it--

82
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,601
allowing people to do it
for free is very important.

83
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:10,367
With standards like H.264,
for example,

84
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:12,934
there's a big risk that everyone
that puts video on the web

85
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,801
is gonna have to pay money.

86
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,434
And at Mozilla,
we have really worked for

87
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:20,534
making it easy and cheap
to put stuff on the web.

88
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,100
So...

89
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,234
Schroepfer: Okay.

90
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,934
So, Ian, bringing this to you,

91
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,601
if you could uninvent
a standard

92
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:28,000
that's in existence today,

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
which standard would you
uninvent?

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,133
Ian: So I think if I could
uninvent a standard,

95
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,868
what I would uninvent is
things that are sort of

96
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,734
de facto standards,
but not actual standards.

97
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,400
There's a lot of these things
out there

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,667
that cause problems for us
sort of alternative browsers,

99
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,400
if you will.

100
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
One great example of this
is ActiveX.

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,267
You know, it's not
an actual standard

102
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,467
that we all sat down
and agreed upon.

103
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,934
But yet, a lot of people,

104
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,467
especially in the Asian
regions--

105
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,634
Like, if you're looking at
e-banking in Korea,

106
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,100
Japan, China,

107
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,968
they're all using
ActiveX controls,

108
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,534
which isn't something that
we can support on Mac and Linux.

109
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:07,067
It's not something that,
you know,

110
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,634
we all sat down
and tried to figure out

111
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:11,067
what's the best API for this--
how do we do it the best way?

112
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:14,067
So I think a lot of these things
that are sort of

113
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:18,267
proprietary standards
that never really made it

114
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,634
through the web standards
process--

115
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,968
I would love to see us have
an opportunity to go back

116
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,501
and figure out, you know,

117
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,868
what are we actually trying
to support here?

118
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:28,701
How can we do this
in an open way

119
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,100
that everyone can implement?

120
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,934
Implement securely,
implement Cross-Platform.

121
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:37,767
And just do it in a more
webby, standards-friendly way.

122
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,868
Schroepfer: Okay, I've got
an open question for the panel.

123
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,100
So whichever of you
would like to respond.

124
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,334
If I'm a web developer--

125
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,067
so I'm building websites,
for example--

126
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,234
and I wanted to talk
to the browser vendors

127
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:49,734
and lobby on behalf
of a particular new standard,

128
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,667
or change a new implementation
to be done,

129
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,667
how do I get in touch with you?

130
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,334
How do I help influence
the process

131
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,200
by which you decide
what you're gonna build

132
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,734
in the next version
of the browser

133
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,033
that affects the entire
web ecosystem?

134
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,868
Charles: So the dumb answer
is email, right?

135
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,834
Because we all read
a lot of it.

136
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:08,167
I think part
of the smart answer is

137
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,801
you get your users to become
very visible.

138
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,334
If you've got something
that you're building,

139
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:17,767
then show that it's interesting.

140
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,167
Because the browsers look around
at what's going on in the web.

141
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,267
A lot of the input
to things that we're gonna do

142
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,534
in standardization

143
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,100
comes from things that people
are trying to do,

144
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,167
and getting frustrated by.

145
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:33,234
So building it,

146
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:36,100
and then, instead of hoping
they will come--

147
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,601
because eventually we will.

148
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,801
But building it and then
going to talk to us and say,

149
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:42,901
"This is what I want,"
you know...

150
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,767
And doing it somewhere, like,
you know,

151
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:48,534
go and talk to the W3C--
the working group--

152
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:51,634
or submit it
to a relevant group

153
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,133
where a bunch of browser makers
and a bunch

154
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,567
of the other parts
of the ecosystem

155
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,267
are already present.

156
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:02,701
Because it's not just browsers.
You've got to have browsers.

157
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:05,167
You've got to have the tools
that people are gonna use.

158
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,133
If you build something--
If we build some format,

159
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,234
and you can't make
authoring tools for it,

160
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:12,801
then we've got a problem,
right?

161
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,234
Because you've got a bit
of the ecosystem missing.

162
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,667
But basically make it,

163
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,601
and then find the forum
we're sitting in

164
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:23,000
where we talk about this stuff.

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,100
3D Canvas is an example
of something where--

166
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,067
We went to a place--
we ended up at Cronos,

167
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,834
which seemed to be
a reasonable organization.

168
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:34,334
We would like it to be more open
in the way it works.

169
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:38,167
But it's got the right people
working on the right technology.

170
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,033
And, you know, Mozilla,
Opera...

171
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:44,801
People out in the wide world
all went and said,

172
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:48,734
"We want to do 3-D stuff.
Let's go and do it together."

173
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:52,100
Jonas: I think showing that
there's a need for something

174
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,367
is a very good way
of building support for,

175
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,767
or ensuring that browsers
will get excited

176
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,000
to implement something.

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,267
There's an infinite number
of suggestions,

178
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:06,334
and it's very rare that
someone sends in a suggestion

179
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:07,934
to a standards body
or to a browser--

180
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:10,000
just shoots away one email,

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,467
and then everyone gets
so excited about that idea

182
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,000
that people start
implementing it.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,334
It has happened, and it's
usually very small things.

184
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,701
But more what happens is that

185
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:23,701
you do the best you can
without it, or--

186
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:27,067
So for example, with 3D,
as soon as Canvas came out,

187
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:31,033
people started doing, like,
Doom and 3D games in Canvas.

188
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,601
And it's horribly slow,
but it sort of works.

189
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,234
You can sort of see
potential there.

190
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:40,100
So people did the best they can
with the tools that were there,

191
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,467
and thereby showed that
if we only had

192
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,901
this other tool as well,

193
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,534
we could do the things we're
doing, but more awesome.

194
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:51,701
So that is a very good way
of getting browsers

195
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,734
and getting standards
organization to take interest

196
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:57,467
is to show that there's
an actual need for it.

197
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,901
Ian: I know a lot of people--
if I could just answer quickly.

198
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,100
I know a lot of people out here
look at us up here

199
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,033
and see, like, Google,
a giant company.

200
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,334
Mozilla, a big browser.

201
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,033
Opera, big player.

202
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,734
Been around
for quite a long time.

203
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:10,901
I think probably one
of the oldest browsers?

204
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,767
Charles: Yeah, I think we're now
the oldest browser

205
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,167
delivering active development
and still around.

206
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,234
Ian: So people look at us
and think, like, "Oh, my gosh,

207
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,667
"they must have a ton
of resources

208
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,367
and giant teams
to work on all of these."

209
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,901
But the reality is that we do
sort of have to pick and choose.

210
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,534
You know, we're looking at,
you know--

211
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,567
what are people actually trying
to do,

212
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,000
as Jonas and Charles said?

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,367
The other side is that,
you know, for Chrome, at least,

214
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,167
and Mozilla as well,
we're open-source.

215
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,534
If you really want to see
something implemented,

216
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:35,868
patches welcome.

217
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:38,667
Go to dev.chromium.org.
All of our source code's there.

218
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,234
We're all hanging out on IRC
and pound Chromium on Freenote.

219
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,901
And you can come talk to us
and pitch an idea and say, like,

220
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:47,033
"Look, this is this
really cool thing I want to do.

221
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,300
"And by the way,
I implemented it.

222
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,534
Here you go.
check it out."

223
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,868
That's a great way
to get it in there too.

224
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,133
Charles: It turns out that
there's no shortage of things

225
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,567
that we could be working on.

226
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:59,467
It's about what other ones
that are really important

227
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:00,834
to the world.

228
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:04,000
So you know,
just implementing code,

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,367
it's like, you know,

230
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,734
is one part of a step
that you can do.

231
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,200
But showing that
this is something that is,

232
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,434
you know, gonna be important
to the world,

233
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,434
that this matters
to other people,

234
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:18,534
is a pretty critical step to
get something to be a standard

235
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:21,000
and not, you know,
a private project.

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,501
Schroepfer: So turning
the question around,

237
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,601
what, as browser developers,
do you wish

238
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,200
more web developers were doing

239
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,701
to take advantage of
next-generation technologies

240
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,901
in existing
or upcoming browsers?

241
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,234
What do you wish you saw
on the web?

242
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:36,801
Jonas: It's really awesome when
you put the new technology--

243
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,167
even if you just--

244
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,601
especially when you put it
in an alpha or beta release.

245
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,367
And to see people start
playing around with it

246
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:44,701
and do amazing things that
you had just never imagined

247
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,701
that people would do with it.

248
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:48,801
Like with the Canvas,
when that came.

249
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:52,601
So playing with early
alphas and betas is

250
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:53,901
a really good way.

251
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,767
And also, these people tend
to find bugs,

252
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,334
and these are bugs that
we can fix before the release.

253
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:01,501
And this prevents things where,
you know,

254
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,834
there was a bug
in an initial release,

255
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,934
and now everyone has to deal
with that bug,

256
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,434
and we can't fix it because
people have started

257
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,767
depending on it.

258
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,767
Fixing those things before,

259
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,701
because people find them
in alphas and betas,

260
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,367
is really nice.

261
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:19,601
Um, also, like,
just pushing the limits.

262
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,534
Daring to do demos,
at least,

263
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,400
that only work
with one browser.

264
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,100
I can understand the reluctance,

265
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,334
and I do want people
to develop sites

266
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,000
that work in all browsers.

267
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,501
But at least playing around
with technologies

268
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,000
that only exist in one browser.

269
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,834
Not necessarily Firefox, but
you're welcome to do that too.

270
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,434
But people playing around
with new technologies

271
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,367
and doing things
that we had never imagined

272
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,901
is really cool.

273
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,767
Charles: Sorry, go, Ian.

274
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,934
Ian: I think we talk a lot about
this chicken and egg scenario.

275
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,501
You know, I don't know
if you're the chicken

276
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,801
or if you're the egg.

277
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,000
But a lot of us want
to think that, oh,

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,100
the other person needs
to do something first.

279
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,033
And I think that, really,
we just need to act.

280
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:04,334
So on the Google Chrome team,
we're starting to look

281
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,968
at CSS3 and Vertical Text.

282
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:08,834
Is anyone really using
Vertical Text right now?

283
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,234
No, not really,
but on the other hand,

284
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,734
there's no option to do it.

285
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,367
So we're just gonna go ahead,
and we're gonna do it.

286
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,167
And I would love it if
some of you

287
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,567
content publishers out there
would go ahead

288
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,968
and start implementing
Vertical Text on your site,

289
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:21,667
even though
it might not work yet.

290
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,968
Because when it does,
there's gonna be a lot of users,

291
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,200
like Japan, you know,
surprised.

292
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,701
They wake up in the morning,

293
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,534
and their newspaper is
still vertical.

294
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:32,167
It hasn't changed--
their language hasn't changed

295
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,133
just because the web has
some restriction.

296
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,501
So we're working on lifting
those restrictions.

297
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,701
I would say that
what would really help me is

298
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,667
if you guys would start working
on the parts

299
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,267
that you have control over,

300
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,434
such that when we're both there,
it'll just work.

301
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:49,534
And I think that the first time
that someone wakes up,

302
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,534
and they see, you know,
oh, my gosh,

303
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,934
Wikipedia is now Vertical
in Japanese.

304
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,567
It's like reading it
in a newspaper.

305
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,701
Oh, my gosh, this web comic
now has Vertical Text,

306
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,167
just like the manga I read
on my table.

307
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,767
You know, I think
that's going to be

308
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,234
a very, sort of,
eye-opening moment.

309
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:07,801
And after that happens,
it'll accelerate demand,

310
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:10,033
and people will start creating
more content.

311
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,133
More browsers will start
implementing.

312
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,767
And so I would say just forget

313
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,200
the whole chicken and egg
argument, and just do it.

314
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,467
Charles: So I'd also like to
say, you know,

315
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,734
figure out the experimental
stuff and, yeah,

316
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:22,400
get all of the
experimental toys,

317
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,734
and play with them
and push them,

318
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:27,734
and make experiments
and show us where, you know,

319
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:29,200
this thing can go.

320
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,501
And show us where
we should be thinking next,

321
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,801
and give out all the new ideas.

322
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,467
And figure out how to separate
the experimental stuff

323
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:41,167
and the hacking around
from building ordinary stuff.

324
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,133
Ordinary stuff should be
built right.

325
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,667
So you know,
if you're building a piece

326
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,400
of crazy,
experimental sculpture

327
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,334
to show off what can be done
with a material,

328
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,000
you build a crazy thing.

329
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,033
If you're building a bridge,
get the standards right.

330
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,801
You know, figure out
how to do it properly,

331
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,434
and use the technology
that we've got properly.

332
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:01,000
And that's really important,

333
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,033
because the more time we spend
messing around

334
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,868
existing broken rubbish,

335
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:10,033
the less time we spend
doing interesting things.

336
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,567
And that frustrates
our engineers,

337
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:16,767
who like making cool stuff
rather than patching bad HTML.

338
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:20,133
And it frustrates
the developers

339
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,334
because the browsers spend
all their time patching bad HTML

340
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:26,300
instead of giving
more interesting functionality.

341
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,234
Schroepfer: So one of
the challenges of pushing

342
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,734
new standards and browsers

343
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,400
is getting those new browsers
adopted on users' desktops.

344
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,968
I'm sure, as anyone
in the audience

345
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,367
who's building
a major web site,

346
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,601
probably still has to support
both IE 6 and Firefox 2,

347
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,100
because together they're
a reasonable portion

348
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,200
of their user base.

349
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,334
What are all of you doing

350
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,133
to aggressively get your users
to upgrade

351
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,667
to the latest version
of the browsers

352
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,501
that have the latest
and newest standards?

353
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,834
Ian: I can answer that.
[laughter]

354
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,334
If you're running
Google Chrome,

355
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,534
you're running
the latest version.

356
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:55,801
Which I know Firefox does
some auto-updates,

357
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,534
not quite as aggressively
as Chrome.

358
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:00,167
But I think that,
you know,

359
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,267
there's certainly a good case
to be made

360
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:03,934
for doing automatic updates,

361
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:06,734
and I'd like to see more people
move towards that direction.

362
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:09,601
It helps keep the web browsers
up to date.

363
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,334
And that's good not only
from a functionality

364
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:12,868
and standards perspective,

365
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,300
but also, when there's
a security bug that we patch,

366
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,801
we're able to push out
an update,

367
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,200
and it goes out to the vast
majority of our users

368
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,634
very quickly.

369
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:22,601
So I'd really like to see,
you know, more browsers--

370
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,334
Charles: Have a look at
our containers.

371
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,567
Go to Auto Update in it.
[chuckles]

372
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:30,868
Yeah, there are some issues
with Auto Update, right?

373
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:33,801
There are issues about systems.

374
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:37,067
People who run, you know,
very secured systems,

375
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,200
or systems where,
for some reason,

376
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,234
they want to have a lot
of control.

377
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:43,367
You don't put
the space shuttle onto

378
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,000
the beta version of anything,
right?

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,100
And there are other places
where you don't want to

380
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
update everything automatically.

381
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,968
If you use a browser
twice a week,

382
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,601
and you pay a lot of money
for your data,

383
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:58,634
you don't want the browser
costing you ten bucks a week,

384
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:00,834
'cause that's five bucks
a page.

385
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,834
You should be able
to turn the update off.

386
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,133
You should be in control.

387
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,667
But yeah, Auto Update,
making it easy for the user

388
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,868
to just have the thing
that is the latest version

389
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,334
is important.

390
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:15,300
Making the latest version
actually better quality--

391
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,634
You know, make sure that
it's an improvement

392
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:20,367
and that it's a real upgrade
and not a, you know,

393
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:22,934
"We made a new version, and
you should have that anyway."

394
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,033
Because if you do that
a couple of times,

395
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,200
people say,
"Well, wait a minute,

396
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,334
"you guys don't necessarily
improve--

397
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:31,334
I don't want to upgrade."

398
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:33,334
So that attention to quality,

399
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,334
getting stuff right
is important.

400
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,133
Jonas: I think it's--

401
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,400
There's definitely advantages
and disadvantages

402
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,834
to pushing the latest version
automatically.

403
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:45,267
It is scary to push
a new major release

404
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:47,934
because there's always gonna be
some amount of things

405
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:49,467
that break
with a new major release.

406
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,434
If you fix a bug,
a site is gonna break.

407
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,000
That's just how the web works.

408
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,968
So pushing new major releases,

409
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,601
we're talking a lot
about how to do that.

410
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,033
I think it's very important--

411
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,934
For security updates,
it's very important

412
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:05,767
that it's--it's--
because they come so often,

413
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,934
it's important that
it's very smooth,

414
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,801
and it's unnoticeable
for the user

415
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,501
so the user doesn't
get bothered.

416
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:13,834
Because nothing really
should break over that anyway.

417
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,567
With major releases,
I think it's very important

418
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,834
that users know
that there's an upgrade.

419
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,133
We find many times that
our users

420
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,934
that are still on Firefox 2
just didn't know

421
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,133
that Firefox 3
had been released.

422
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,767
Somehow they missed
the dialogue.

423
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:31,100
Even if we'd pushed up
an announcement

424
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,133
two or three times
to all the users,

425
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,167
somehow they missed it
because maybe their mom was

426
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,467
using the computer,

427
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,567
or someone else was using
the computer

428
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,434
and just clicked "cancel"
because they didn't know

429
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:43,634
that they wanted to upgrade.

430
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,334
So it's very important
that users know

431
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:46,634
that there's an upgrade.

432
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:50,167
And it should also be very easy
to do the upgrade.

433
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:54,634
The easy part is something
that we decided

434
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:58,767
very early on in Firefox--
it should be almost transparent.

435
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,200
The user should just,
at the most,

436
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,601
have to click a "yes" button.

437
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:04,434
If users have to download
and install

438
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,133
and go through
an entire process again,

439
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:09,133
you immediately drop
a big hunk of users.

440
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,868
If you can't do it
in two, three seconds,

441
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:13,334
you've lost a bunch
of users already.

442
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:18,701
So whether to push,
automatically, major releases,

443
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:21,200
we're still debating.

444
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,033
There's definitely users
that want both ways.

445
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,801
And I also think
it's very important

446
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,334
that users are in control.

447
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:28,934
If users don't want to upgrade,

448
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,667
they should be able to,
at all times,

449
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,801
make a conscious decision
and say,

450
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,067
"I don't want more upgrades."

451
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,834
For whatever reason
there may be.

452
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,267
Charles: So there's
another issue, right?

453
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,200
My father-in-law is
82 years old,

454
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,901
and his computer is not quite
as old as he is.

455
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:47,834
But it runs Windows '98.

456
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,567
'Cause it turns out
that I couldn't find

457
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,634
a Linux distribution
easily available

458
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,601
that would fit
on the machine.

459
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,968
And it also turns out
that I could only find

460
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:59,400
one browser
that's a modern browser

461
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,667
that will fit into the machine.

462
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,734
There's a lot
of this stuff around.

463
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:07,634
So, you know, wanting everybody
to have the latest everything--

464
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:08,834
It's like, you know,
one solution is

465
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,400
go out and buy
the whole world

466
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,901
the latest piece of hardware
to run it.

467
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:16,000
But that's probably not
the best way

468
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,167
we could spend all our money.

469
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,868
So you've got to
actually recognize

470
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:22,801
that some of these limits
come from things

471
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,501
that are quite important
to people,

472
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,100
and things that are
pretty fundamental.

473
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,033
Schroepfer: So looking at
the composition of this panel,

474
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,834
I'm noticing two
major absences.

475
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:34,701
Our friends at Apple
and Microsoft are not here,

476
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:37,200
which collectively have
more than about 50%

477
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,100
of the browser market share, if
I have the recent stats right.

478
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,868
What are you doing
to work well

479
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:43,400
with the entire
browser community

480
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,767
to make sure that, as a new
and important standard gets out,

481
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,467
it gets implemented
across all the major browsers

482
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,133
so that web developers can count
on that feature being there

483
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,534
when they're deploying
their web site

484
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:55,200
in the real world?

485
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,234
Jonas: I find a very
important part is

486
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,734
in the standards process--

487
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,100
when you're defining
a new standard--

488
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,667
it's very important to get--
to have all the parties

489
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,200
that have interest
in the standard

490
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,901
and are going to implement
the standard,

491
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:10,100
to have them involved
so that they can give input.

492
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,567
First of all, I think if you
don't have a party involved,

493
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,367
it's very easy to accidentally
put something in the standard

494
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,300
that someone just can't
implement--

495
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,968
that is just physically
too hard.

496
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,901
Some of those things are
actually already on the web,

497
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,200
unfortunately.

498
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,901
But...so there's
that aspect.

499
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,934
The other thing is that
it's just--

500
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,200
if someone just
throws a standard in your lap

501
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,300
and says,
"Here, go implement it,"

502
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,968
then you'll be
much less excited to do that

503
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,167
than if you get to be part of
the development process.

504
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,400
You get to give your input.

505
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,334
You get to put your print
on it.

506
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:48,767
So that way you'll be
more excited about it

507
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,901
than going forward
and implementing it.

508
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:55,367
So I think getting
all browser vendors involved

509
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:59,234
in the standards community
is very important.

510
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:01,367
Schroepfer: So are you working
with Microsoft and Apple

511
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,767
directly on these standards
today?

512
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,734
Is that a process as well?
Charles: Yeah, yeah.

513
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:09,067
It's nice to know that Apple
is involved in standards stuff

514
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,701
much more than they're in
anywhere else.

515
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,400
It's a pain in the ass when it
turns out that they're involved

516
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,801
because they sent their
patent declaration

517
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:20,033
and said, you know, "We're gonna
block all of this stuff."

518
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:23,033
And we've got to figure out
a way around dealing with that.

519
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,000
But in general, yeah.

520
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,868
These other browsers are
actually involved

521
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,534
in standards development.

522
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:32,033
I think another important thing
that we do is compete, right?

523
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,801
Each browser has users.

524
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,868
Each browser has developers
who are pushing

525
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,200
what they want to do,

526
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,133
and following the latest
Fileo

527
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,601
and the interactivity stuff
in Opera,

528
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:47,300
or the latest stuff in Firefox
or Chrome or whatever.

529
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,434
And because we're actually
competing with each other

530
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:51,968
as well, we're looking around
and seeing, you know,

531
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,934
what is it that attracts
these people

532
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,567
to some other browser?

533
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,300
And part of it is
the new functionalities

534
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,667
that they develop.

535
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:05,000
The fact that Firefox
and IE and Opera

536
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and Apple and Chrome
and other browsers

537
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,601
that no one here knows of

538
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,334
all have active communities,
and support them,

539
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:16,400
and get them developing stuff,
keeps all of us on our toes.

540
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,567
Makes us look around and say,

541
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,601
"We've got to follow that
as well."

542
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:20,934
We've got to actually
figure out

543
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:23,667
is that something
that's worth standardizing--

544
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,901
that's worth doing
across the web--

545
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,200
or is this some weird thing
that's gonna die off

546
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,968
in a corner?

547
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:33,167
And when a browser
comes up with something

548
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,767
and makes it work,

549
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:38,300
it's great, you know,
if you take it and say,

550
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,000
look, we want to standardize
this.

551
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,334
It helps the browser,

552
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,501
It helps the developer
community,

553
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:47,267
and it helps the other browsers
have a reason

554
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,467
to sit down and talk
to each other.

555
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,467
Ian: I think we should point out
that everyone up here--

556
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,934
You know, first of all,
we're nice people.

557
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:57,734
But we do try to be as open
and as--

558
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,601
We do as much outreach
as we can.

559
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:04,934
So when we're developing
something like Canvas 3D or O3D,

560
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:09,868
we tend not to see it
as some whizbang advantage

561
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:12,434
that's going to get more usage
for our browser,

562
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,133
and get people to switch
from other browsers

563
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,934
because only we are gonna
support O3D, Canvas 3D.

564
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,467
That's not what we're trying
to do.

565
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,400
Like, what we're trying to do
is figure out

566
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,901
how do we move the web forward?

567
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:25,267
And so when we do things
like Canvas 3D, you know,

568
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:27,167
there was a very active effort.

569
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,400
Everyone from Mozilla was
reaching out trying to see,

570
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,734
okay, how do we get people
from Google?

571
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:33,133
How do we get people
from Opera and Microsoft?

572
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:36,033
And how do we get all the people
to the same table

573
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,367
and talk about this

574
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,200
so that when we're actually
developing this,

575
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,934
we know about the issues
ahead of time?

576
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:44,100
We don't want to get
to a point where we have a spec,

577
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,167
and two years later,
the other browsers,

578
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,100
who weren't the first to
implement, start implementing

579
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,000
and realize, oh, my gosh,
this doesn't work

580
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,701
in a multiprocess model,
or, oh, my gosh,

581
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:58,901
we can't do this
on top of Direct X

582
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:01,968
because the OpenGL Shader
Language is different.

583
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:04,734
You know, we do try to reach out
as early as we can

584
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,801
because we want to know if
there are these sorts of issues

585
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:08,300
that are gonna hold us up.

586
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,400
Sometimes it's unfortunate
when we find out these issues,

587
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,634
be they patent issues
or technical issues,

588
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,767
because, you know,
sometimes they're setbacks,

589
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,400
and we want
to get things done quickly.

590
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,400
But I think that we all realize
that it's much better for us

591
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,367
to find this out early
in the process,

592
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,400
as opposed to at the end
of the process.

593
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,534
So I think we're all trying
to be as open as we can.

594
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:29,100
Jonas: The whole, like,
implementing a standard

595
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,968
in order to compete
kind of doesn't work.

596
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:34,334
I've never heard of any user
switching to Firefox

597
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:36,667
because we support
animated PNG, for example.

598
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:43,300
People switch to browsers
because websites work nicely,

599
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,801
because the browser works nicely
with the user.

600
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,701
Generally speaking,
most sites write such that

601
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,200
they work in all browsers.

602
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,601
So--that's generally speaking.

603
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,701
But there's very few times
that I'll switch--

604
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:03,300
or someone switches to a browser
because it has a new standard.

605
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,434
If a standard only works
in one browser,

606
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:08,434
no site is gonna rely on it
anyway, generally speaking.

607
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:12,968
So there's no competitive
advantage there, really,

608
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:14,434
for users.

609
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:16,100
Charles: Well, so there's not
for users,

610
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,534
but there's an advantage
for developers, right?

611
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:18,701
Jonas: Yes.

612
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:20,767
Charles: The developers want
to figure out

613
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,501
how to play
with the new technology.

614
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,801
And in order for developers
to experiment

615
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,167
with new the technology,

616
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,801
they do go from one set
of new technology to another,

617
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,267
figure out what they like.

618
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:34,801
And it's not that, you know,
implementing this feature

619
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:38,534
is gonna get my mom
to switch her browser.

620
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:44,033
But it will give a developer
a place to experiment.

621
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:49,367
So there's standardization,
and there's innovation,

622
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,100
and they're separate processes.

623
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,501
Innovation is where you start
building the experiment.

624
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:56,667
Standardization is where
you've seen the experiment

625
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,334
and what people have done
with it, and you've said, yeah,

626
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,200
we need to actually
make this work properly.

627
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,934
And then we take a step back,
and we get it all right,

628
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:09,400
and we make sure it works
on mobiles and in Arabic

629
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,367
and in Japanese
with Vertical Text,

630
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:14,901
and in dual-processor systems.

631
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:22,300
And so the innovation stuff
that drives the creativity

632
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,033
and the development

633
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,267
comes back down
to standardization

634
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,734
at a different level.

635
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:32,434
So I agree that, you know,
you don't win users

636
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:35,334
because you implement
some standard thing.

637
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:39,734
But you do get creativity,
you get innovation,

638
00:25:39,734 --> 00:25:42,267
and you get a chance for people
to make applications.

639
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:44,000
Schroepfer: So if you're not--
I'm sorry.

640
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,901
If you're not competing
on a standard

641
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,300
on the web platform,

642
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,601
what's the pitch
from each of you

643
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,734
in terms of why I,
as a newbie user,

644
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:53,167
should use Opera,
Firefox, or Chrome?

645
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,501
And why are you competing
in the market?

646
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:57,968
Why not join efforts into one
super-browser project

647
00:25:57,968 --> 00:25:59,634
where you pool your efforts
into building

648
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:02,300
the latest and greatest
web-rendering engine?

649
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,400
Charles: Because we'd have to
downsize all the engineers.

650
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,334
Jonas: We don't like each other
that much.

651
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:08,868
Ian: I was just gonna say,
I mean, it's not that we don't--

652
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,534
We do sort of compete.

653
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:12,567
Like, things like JavaScript,
you know.

654
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,934
There was a slide
in the keynote that showed

655
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,667
how fast JavaScript
had gotten.

656
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,934
If there weren't
multiple browsers,

657
00:26:19,934 --> 00:26:22,767
I don't know that that curve
would be as sharp as it is.

658
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,167
You know,
within the past year,

659
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,000
we've seen JavaScript
in all the major browsers

660
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,734
make leaps and bounds.

661
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:31,901
And I think that, you know,
part of this is

662
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:34,167
us competing
for developer love.

663
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,200
Part of it is just, you know,
if you're a user,

664
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,868
and you're loading Gmail,
which is getting more complex

665
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,868
as more features get
added in,

666
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:43,234
you want that to load quickly.

667
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,434
And if you start realizing that,
you know what,

668
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:48,033
it's taking ten seconds
in my browser to load,

669
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,667
but when I switch
to Google Chrome,

670
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,033
it comes up in one second...

671
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:53,667
You know, maybe then
that's gonna force the--

672
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,667
convince the user
to switch over.

673
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,200
So you know,
we're not trying to compete

674
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,033
in terms of these are standards
I'm going to implement,

675
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,033
these are standards
I'm not going to implement.

676
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:06,701
But we are certainly competing
in terms of user experience,

677
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:10,334
how well do we render the web,
how shiny is our browser,

678
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:11,701
how nice does it look,

679
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,934
how does it feel
to use this overall?

680
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,567
Charles: A lot of the pitch is,
you know,

681
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:20,000
the browser makes your life
better, right?

682
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,467
The more the browser
helps you do--

683
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,767
the things you're actually
trying to do.

684
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,501
Because very, very few people
in the world

685
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,868
have a job of using
a browser.

686
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:31,300
It's like mostly their job is
use the browser to do something.

687
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,834
And making that thing
work better for them

688
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:36,501
is a big bunch
of where we compete.

689
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:39,434
Why do we not all do,
you know, the same thing?

690
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:41,667
Yeah, I agree with him.
We would stagnate.

691
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,868
We had the fastest JavaScript
engine around for ages,

692
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,267
and we didn't do a lot
of work on it

693
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:49,100
because nobody else cared
about speeding JavaScript.

694
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,300
And so nothing happened.

695
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,968
And then all of a sudden
people said wait a minute.

696
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:55,133
They started building
these heavy Ajax apps,

697
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:58,767
and JavaScript became important,
and we pushed each other.

698
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:02,167
You know, engineers are
individuals,

699
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:04,334
and groups are slightly
different,

700
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:05,834
with different cultures.

701
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:08,400
They're interested
in slightly different stuff.

702
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,033
They compete.
People like competing.

703
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:14,467
So a race to build the fastest
JavaScript engine

704
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:17,400
is much more fun when
there's more than one entrant.

705
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,934
Because a one-person race is
kind of dull to watch.

706
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:25,200
And not much fun
to participate in.

707
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,400
Jonas: Yeah, I mean,
the performance is definitely

708
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,734
an important aspect
of how we compete.

709
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:35,534
There's also, like,
user experience, stability.

710
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:39,834
It's basically,
the interface towards users are

711
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,534
a major competitive point.

712
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:46,534
Do I like the Chrome UI and the
features that Chrome provides,

713
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:48,968
or do I like the Firefox UI
or the Opera UI?

714
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:52,067
So it's sort of how
you interact with the browser,

715
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:54,634
which browser
you feel comfortable with

716
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:59,667
that's more of a competitive
vector.

717
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,901
Also, performance has gotten
very, very important lately.

718
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,701
I think there's just been
some sort of critical mass

719
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,501
behind the performance message.

720
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,901
Also, websites have gotten
so complex

721
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:13,000
the they actually get
to be slower.

722
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,133
And so that's why people care
about performance these days

723
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,934
much more than we did
just a few years ago.

724
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:20,968
Schroepfer: So speaking
of JavaScript engines,

725
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,934
between the, you know, 2x,
3x year over year improvements

726
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:25,133
in JavaScript speed,

727
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:27,000
and new standards like
worker threads,

728
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,767
which allows me to do
background processing

729
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,767
without locking up
the main UI,

730
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,334
there's a lot more power
on the client

731
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:33,701
than there used to be.

732
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:35,734
Like, by some benchmarks,
the JS engines are faster

733
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,100
than many other
interpretive languages,

734
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,634
like PHP or Python.

735
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:41,601
If I'm a web developer,
and I'm re-architecting my site

736
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:43,200
or building a new site
from scratch,

737
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,801
and I'm making a key decision,

738
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,968
which is how much work
do I do on the client

739
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:48,300
versus the server?

740
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,234
Or which work do I do
on the client or the server?

741
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:54,434
What's your advice to me
on how to figure that out?

742
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:55,934
Charles: Carefully.
[chuckles]

743
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:58,701
Ian: Make it modular.

744
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,901
The nice thing about
a good modular design is that

745
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:04,000
it should be pretty easy
to take some module,

746
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,133
some part of that
and shift it over.

747
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,100
So I'd say that, you know,
if your--

748
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,000
if you want to be
really forward-looking

749
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,601
and think, you know, okay,
how do I take advantage

750
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,501
of what's coming up in browsers
the next few years?

751
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,133
How do I take advantage
of speed?

752
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:18,133
How do I take advantage
of new features?

753
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:20,334
Design your code in such a way
that, you know,

754
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:23,667
if there is a part that
you think might be separable,

755
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,734
write it in such a way,
such that, you know,

756
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:27,968
two years from now,
if it might make more sense

757
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:29,701
to do it on the client,
it's easy to swap it out.

758
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:33,667
Don't write it as just
one giant monolithic PHP file

759
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,334
that, you know, is one class,
one function.

760
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,701
That's gonna hurt.

761
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,834
And that's just good
coding practice in general.

762
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,901
Jonas: And there's
a general coding rule

763
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:46,067
that's something, like,

764
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,467
"too early optimizations is
the root of all evil."

765
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:52,667
And that's, like, if you start
thinking about performance,

766
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,701
and start doing performance
before you actually have

767
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:57,334
anything else,

768
00:30:57,334 --> 00:31:01,467
and then you are probably
gonna optimize things

769
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,133
that you don't need
to optimize.

770
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:06,567
And it's much better
to optimize for code quality

771
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,067
so that once you have
something working,

772
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,968
and you can see what is slow,

773
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:13,901
at that point
you can optimize that.

774
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:17,167
There's also the case that
the platform--

775
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,501
The web platform changes
extremely rapidly right now,

776
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,501
so whatever is
the correct answer now

777
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:25,200
is not going to be
the correct answer in two years.

778
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,667
So you better be prepared.

779
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,234
You better build your code such
that you can easily change it.

780
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,734
Charles: You also want
to think about--

781
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:34,434
You know, the web platform
is not like a single platform.

782
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,801
The difference between
a small device--

783
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,234
you know, a Nintendo DS,

784
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:41,501
which is a pretty
low-spec machine

785
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:45,000
compared to some
shiny new laptop--

786
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,033
You don't necessarily want
the code to run the same way

787
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,400
on both things.

788
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,901
So keep it simple,
you know.

789
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,400
One thing, just cut it down,
if you can.

790
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,167
And figure out, you know--

791
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,434
As Ian says, work out where
you can shift stuff across

792
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,067
from one to the other.

793
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:03,033
Keep your code flexible so
you can deal with the changes.

794
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,400
Ian: I think that a lot
of the advice that we've heard

795
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,534
over the years--

796
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:08,267
especially when CSS started
coming out,

797
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,667
people were, like, you know,
you need to be really good

798
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,667
about separating
your program logic

799
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,868
from your presentation layer
from your data.

800
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:18,567
Had you done that, you'd be in
a much better state right now.

801
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,400
Because when mobile started
taking off,

802
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,934
you could say, well,
I've got my application code.

803
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:24,267
That's still pretty much
the same.

804
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:26,100
My data isn't really changing
that much.

805
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,601
But my presentation layer sort
of needs to change from mobile.

806
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,234
So that transition might not
have been

807
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:31,567
quite as painful for you.

808
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,334
Now that we're talking
about offline,

809
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,367
you know, if all of your stuff
is service side--

810
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,567
all your presentation logic
is service side,

811
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,300
and now you're trying
to move that offline,

812
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,400
that's gonna be hard.

813
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,567
But had you separated that
a few years ago,

814
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:45,801
you could say, well, okay,
now some part of that is

815
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,100
moving down to the client.

816
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,701
But I've already got
this nice separation,

817
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:49,968
so there's a layer
I can rewrite.

818
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,367
So I think a lot
of the advice

819
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,133
that people have been giving
for years still applies.

820
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,934
Charles: And I go back
to the "carefully" thing,

821
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,434
because it's like--

822
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,067
It's not enough to say, well,
I have all this stuff in CSS

823
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,901
and HTML and JavaScript.

824
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:03,400
I've got all this separation.

825
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,901
It's how you actually conceive
of the stuff,

826
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,100
how it fits together.

827
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,267
Because you can write
one huge piece of code

828
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:14,801
that is actually very cleanly
and beautifully structured

829
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,934
in your understanding
of how it works.

830
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:19,734
And you can simply
pull pieces out and put 'em in.

831
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,701
And you can write stuff
that's got modules

832
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:24,000
all over the place
where, in fact,

833
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,467
the modules are just this
giant spaghetti stuff

834
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,434
connecting things.

835
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:29,767
Schroepfer: So this is great
general advice.

836
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,300
Can you think of
specific examples

837
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,234
you could point people at
where you think people are

838
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:35,567
taking advantage of the next
generation JavaScript engines,

839
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:37,601
or offline, or worker threads

840
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,534
to do things in a way
that we maybe wouldn't have

841
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,133
built web applications before?

842
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,968
It's a good example for me,
as a web developer,

843
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:45,734
to see here's an example
of how you could use

844
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,934
some of these next-gen
technologies.

845
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:51,767
Jonas: I thought it was pretty
cool the other day when I--

846
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,434
Because I use--
To read email on my phone

847
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:58,567
I use Safari and Gmail,
'cause I use the iPhone.

848
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:03,434
And it was pretty cool when,
a few months ago,

849
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:07,100
or a few weeks ago,
all of a sudden the UI changed

850
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,934
and became much snappier.

851
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,601
And it turned out
that it was because

852
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:14,501
they're using the client-side
SQL API.

853
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:17,267
And so if--

854
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,234
I don't know exactly
how the caching works,

855
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:21,100
but many times, instead of
having to download

856
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,701
all your emails,

857
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:24,200
it has them already
on the phone.

858
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,167
So it was noticeably
more snappier.

859
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,501
They're still working
on some bugs,

860
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,400
because oftentimes
you end up seeing

861
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,634
two old emails, and you have to
manually refresh it.

862
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,834
So there's definitely
still bugs there,

863
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:38,968
but it's a very interesting
sort of first draft,

864
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:42,200
or first take
on improving performance

865
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,133
by using these new APIs.

866
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,701
Ian: And I think that
the current trend towards

867
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:47,100
using web toolkits,

868
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,267
be that GWT
or other toolkits out there--

869
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:54,734
You know,
as it becomes possible

870
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:56,133
to do more things
on the client,

871
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:57,567
or do things in different ways--

872
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:00,200
For instance, if some code
that you compiled on GWT

873
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,934
would now run better
were you using a worker thread,

874
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,200
that change can be made
in the toolkit

875
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,834
so that you,
as an application developer,

876
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,901
might not even have
to do anything.

877
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:12,133
We, as the toolkit provider,
could make that change.

878
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,701
So I think that, you know,
if you're able to use a toolkit,

879
00:35:15,701 --> 00:35:18,667
not only does that help you do
some extraction and clean code,

880
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:22,100
but it also helps other people
help you.

881
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,167
So not to sort of be
all Google here,

882
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:30,601
but things like GWT
are certainly a good way to go.

883
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:32,133
Schroepfer: So last question
from me,

884
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:33,567
and then I'd love to
open it up to the audience.

885
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,267
So we have a microphone
on this side

886
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,367
and a microphone on this side.

887
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,400
If you want to ask
our panel questions,

888
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,367
please come on up
to one of the microphones,

889
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,100
and we'll get you part
of the discussion.

890
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,367
So my last question:
many of you mentioned mobile.

891
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,300
Let's be honest, the browser
state on mobile is a total mess.

892
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,801
I'm sure you've seen
lots of blog posts

893
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:50,934
from people looking at
state of implementation

894
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:53,634
of different standards across
different devices and phones.

895
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:56,534
As a web developer,
it's really hard to understand

896
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,601
exactly how to understand
this landscape,

897
00:35:58,601 --> 00:35:59,801
and how to support--

898
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,033
you know, if I want to support
a billion people

899
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,434
on all of these
different phones,

900
00:36:02,434 --> 00:36:04,434
it's a gargantuan effort
to do it.

901
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,801
So what are all of you doing
to help us clean up

902
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:09,667
the mobile mess,
and get a better set

903
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,400
of supported,
standardized browsers

904
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,067
across mobile devices?

905
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,033
Charles: Make better
mobile browsers.

906
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,334
Jonas: Yeah.

907
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,000
Charles: I mean,
it's not rocket science.

908
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,434
It's just, you know,
hard work.

909
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:22,601
Jonas: I think the big problem
on mobile--

910
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:25,300
I've not done any
mobile development myself,

911
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,067
but from what I've heard,
the big problem is that

912
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:31,434
there's just so many--
there's so many players there.

913
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:34,300
It has been so easy to build,
like, a crappy browser

914
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,367
and put it on mobile phones,
and then people try to use it.

915
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:41,734
Whereas...instead of building
a full-fledged web browser.

916
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:45,067
That's what we at Mozilla is
definitely pushing

917
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:48,200
as an answer to, like,
how do you do a mobile web?

918
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,234
Let's just put the normal web
on the mobile web.

919
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,534
Let's put full web browsers
that have

920
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:57,000
all capabilities of
desktop browsers on cell phones.

921
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,567
Like, doing something
cut down is--

922
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:03,367
that's a very short-sighted
solution.

923
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:08,767
People want to use
all manners of web pages

924
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:12,067
that aren't mobilized yet.

925
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:15,067
And in order to do that,
you need a full web browser.

926
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:18,400
And also, web developers
want to use all the features

927
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,601
that they've become accustomed
to use on desktop.

928
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,200
So they also want
a full browser.

929
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,434
Ian: I think people are also
voting with their feet.

930
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:31,334
People meaning both end-users,
but also phone manufacturers.

931
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:36,067
So right now we see
a huge sale of iPhones.

932
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:38,000
I see a lot of people
in the room with Androids.

933
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,234
I'm not sure why that is.
I think they gave some out.

934
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:43,834
But you know,
if you look at these browsers,

935
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,000
they all have--

936
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,367
I'm sorry,
if you look at these phones,

937
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,701
they all have pretty
full-featured web browsers.

938
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:52,167
Both iPhone and Android browser
happen to be based

939
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,567
off of Webkit,
which is sort of cool for me

940
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:57,901
because a lot of the work that
we do on the Google Chrome team,

941
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,501
we just check straight into
Webkit.

942
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:02,100
Which means that, you know,
not only does it end up

943
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,734
in Safari on the desktop,
but also ends up

944
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,501
in the Safari browser
on iPhone.

945
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:08,434
It ends up
in the Android browser.

946
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:11,367
So I think Webkit is actually
doing a lot of great things

947
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:13,334
for mobile browsers.

948
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,133
Certainly the Opera guys have
a ton of experience

949
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,734
on making good mobile browsers.

950
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,100
And people are voting
with their feet

951
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,968
when they go and download
Opera Mini for their phone.

952
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,601
So I think that, you know,
voting with your feet

953
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:29,567
is also a great way
to sort of encourage people

954
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,334
to do better
in the browser space.

955
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,901
You know, if you're looking at
buying a new phone,

956
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:35,133
buy one that comes with
a good browser.

957
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,434
Charles: Yeah.
Ian: Or buy a good browser.

958
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:39,534
Charles: Or just get
a good browser.

959
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,834
Download Opera Mini,
you know.

960
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,801
If you've got an old,
crappy phone,

961
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:46,701
one of the issues is phone
systems have been pretty closed.

962
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:50,434
Phone operators have been
reluctant to allow people

963
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:52,501
to just install
whatever they want

964
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,701
and do whatever they want
with their phone.

965
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:59,467
And they've been pretty tight
about what could go there.

966
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,834
And phones last a long time.

967
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:06,434
The people who go out
and buy a new phone every year

968
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:10,400
are a fairly small shim
on top of the market.

969
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,901
And the phones, you know,
are out there.

970
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:14,934
If you go around the markets
around the world,

971
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:17,767
you find ten-year-old phones
all over the place.

972
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:21,834
Millions and millions
and millions are sold every week

973
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:23,567
of ten-year-old phones.

974
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:27,634
So part of the issue is, here,
we have this legacy.

975
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:33,801
And working out how to build
systems for old devices...

976
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:38,801
How to bring not the sort of
20 or 50 million

977
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:41,234
richest people in the world
to go out and buy

978
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,501
the fanciest new thing,

979
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:45,801
but the billion or two
who haven't got

980
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,267
the fanciest new thing,

981
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,133
and also haven't got
a desktop computer,

982
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:50,901
and are gonna use the web
on their phone,

983
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:53,267
and will use whatever works
on their phone--

984
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,667
We've gotta deal with that,
because that's a huge part

985
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,567
of what makes up
the market.

986
00:39:58,567 --> 00:39:59,767
Schroepfer: You want to
step up to the mike?

987
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,067
You got a question
for the panel?

988
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,067
man: Sure. I'm Vinny,
from PGP Corporation.

989
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:07,067
You guys know us
from encrypting mail

990
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:09,300
and data content
and stuff like that.

991
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,868
I have an interesting
observation.

992
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:13,901
I've noticed this over the last,
I don't know,

993
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,000
seven years, eight years.

994
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,801
As more and more of the content
has been

995
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:19,767
moving up onto the clouds,
into the web,

996
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,601
the fear that I have
is that

997
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:25,467
that content isn't
very well protected.

998
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,834
Now, when I say "protected"
to a browser developer,

999
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,667
they tend to say to me,
"Well, sure we are.

1000
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,300
"We do SSL, TLS,
or whatever,

1001
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
and we protect the data
going up and down."

1002
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,234
But what I'm thinking about,
and what I hear often

1003
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,334
from, you know, the CSOs--

1004
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:41,968
the chief security officers,
the technology officers...

1005
00:40:41,968 --> 00:40:43,400
folks like the FBI;

1006
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
people who care about
the data itself--

1007
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,067
is that the data itself
is not protected.

1008
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,834
Let me give you two cases
in point,

1009
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:55,067
and I'll offer you
a possible solution.

1010
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:58,501
Most companies that have very,

1011
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:01,767
very savvy chief security
officers

1012
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:05,734
will not let them use iPhones
to access their mail sys--

1013
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,934
They won't let them use Gmail.

1014
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:10,100
Because there's no way
to encrypt that data.

1015
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,934
I can't send an email
through Gmail

1016
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:14,567
and encrypt it, and worry
about it being decrypted.

1017
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, the pipe is protected,

1018
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,734
but that's data's
out of their reach.

1019
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:21,334
Another good example is--

1020
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:23,200
and I've seen this happen
a lot now.

1021
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,934
I've seen companies move
their data offline.

1022
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:29,834
Gosh, we used some third party
to do performance reviews

1023
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,200
for employees.

1024
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,834
And it was interesting to see
that they were typing

1025
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:35,501
all this stuff on what the
employee was gonna do next year

1026
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:37,767
into this off-site web site.

1027
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,434
I said, well, gee,
did you vet the employees

1028
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:40,801
of that off-site web site?

1029
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:43,701
How do you know that that data
is not well-protected?

1030
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,968
And you know, so again,
I've seen this trend of things

1031
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:48,634
moving up there
onto the web,

1032
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:51,634
and people doing backups
off-site.

1033
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:55,400
Now, we've done a couple
of hacks over the years.

1034
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,367
I've tried to address this.

1035
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:59,801
Done some NPAPI plug-ins.

1036
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:03,634
Maybe thought about using Embed
to specify the data

1037
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,100
that is embedded is encrypted,

1038
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,834
and that only the clients
can look at those things.

1039
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,801
But you know, if you look
at the Android phones, and--

1040
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,200
Schroepfer: Sorry,
do you have a question?

1041
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,567
man: Yeah, I do.

1042
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,167
I'm saying that if you look
at the Android phones

1043
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,634
and the iPhones and stuff,

1044
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:20,767
those browsers don't
really offer you

1045
00:42:20,767 --> 00:42:22,334
any way to extend them

1046
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:26,601
to identify that data
should be secure.

1047
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,868
What I'd like to see happen
with the browsers,

1048
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,534
and maybe with HTML
and whatever,

1049
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:33,834
is for you to start
thinking about how to encrypt--

1050
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:36,300
how to specify that data
be encrypted.

1051
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,434
Again, my fear is that,
you know,

1052
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,033
People, like, wonder
about things like Facebook.

1053
00:42:40,033 --> 00:42:41,601
They say, "Gee,
I put these photos up there,

1054
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,701
"but then Facebook can
look at it,

1055
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:44,067
or somebody else can
look at it."

1056
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,934
I'd like to be able to encrypt
that data as a customer,

1057
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:49,100
and only let my friends who have
the right keys look at that.

1058
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
That's my opening question.

1059
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,400
Ian: I think one of the problems
with encryption

1060
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,868
that we've seen so far--

1061
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:56,968
You know, there was this great
sort of seminal paper

1062
00:42:56,968 --> 00:43:00,200
a few years ago called
"Why Johnny Can't Encrypt,"

1063
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,267
which was a great usability--

1064
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:04,934
I think it was called
"Why Johnny Can't Encrypt."

1065
00:43:04,934 --> 00:43:06,200
man:
It's pretty old, yeah.

1066
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,067
Ian: A great usability study
on PGP 5, I think.

1067
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,200
man: We're at ten.

1068
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,801
Ian: Yes, you're at ten.

1069
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:14,934
But one of the things
that came up is it's very hard

1070
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:19,400
to actually figure out
how to teach users what to do.

1071
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,834
You know, people--

1072
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,834
Encryption is not something
that people naturally think of.

1073
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,100
You know, I'll buy
the argument

1074
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,000
that people might want to
protect their email.

1075
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,334
That's a very logical thing
to do.

1076
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:31,234
They might want to protect
what they put on Facebook.

1077
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,868
But I think that
one of the first things

1078
00:43:32,868 --> 00:43:34,434
that really needs to be
worked out

1079
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:38,000
before we go down the path
of standardizing PGP

1080
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,400
into the browser
is figuring out

1081
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,734
how do we actually
make this usable?

1082
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:47,334
You know, show me that
users are actually--

1083
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,067
That there is a good UI
for doing this,

1084
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:53,334
that users want this,
that there is large demand.

1085
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:55,767
I'm pretty that you could
do this in JavaScript

1086
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,400
with a Chrome extension
if you wanted to.

1087
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,434
You know, that might be
a radical statement,

1088
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:03,634
but JavaScript performance
has gotten really good.

1089
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:06,133
It's a Turing-complete language,
so given enough time,

1090
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,367
you probably should be able
to do it.

1091
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:11,501
If someone showed me
a very compelling UI

1092
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:16,601
that would let someone in Gmail
or on Facebook easily say

1093
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:19,300
encrypt this content,
and only let my friends see it,

1094
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,133
and they worked out all
the user-experience issues

1095
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:24,300
and said, "Ian, you know,
I've solved it--here it is,"

1096
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,767
that would be very compelling
for me.

1097
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:30,767
Right now I think those
UX issues are still unresolved.

1098
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:34,334
I don't mean to demean
any particular product

1099
00:44:34,334 --> 00:44:35,634
for implementation,

1100
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,000
but I think we have
a long way to go

1101
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,467
before my mother can
figure out

1102
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:42,067
how to send
an encrypted email to me.

1103
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:44,767
man: So let me retort to you
that along--

1104
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:47,667
A lot of stuff has happened
since that paper was written.

1105
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:52,701
And that I'd say about 90%
of the corporate Fortune 100s

1106
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:55,133
is using, in fact,
our product.

1107
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,634
Okay, um, yes,
I agree with you.

1108
00:44:57,634 --> 00:45:00,133
I'd like to see something
like Embed--

1109
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:03,367
encrypted text,
something key, whatever;

1110
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,801
leave that up to
the implementers--

1111
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,667
It should be a control panel
no one ever sees.

1112
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,067
But those questions are
being solved.

1113
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:11,567
Charles: So the questions are
being asked.

1114
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:14,801
You know, at the beginning, when
I said the exciting technology

1115
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:19,467
was, you know, all this access
to sensitive information--

1116
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:23,067
And it's exciting because
it's not a technology question.

1117
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:26,701
The security stuff is not about:
can we encrypt stuff?

1118
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:28,067
We know how to do that.

1119
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:30,601
It really is about
how do we get people

1120
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:32,701
to understand
what they're doing?

1121
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,801
And how do we get them
to think about it?

1122
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:36,834
And it's really,
really complicated.

1123
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,200
And every time
you get it wrong--

1124
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,767
You know, if you train
a micro-generation of users

1125
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:47,133
to do something that turns out
to be a bad idea,

1126
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:49,734
then you've taken
this huge step backwards.

1127
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:52,701
We have all this
certificate stuff where,

1128
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,234
you know,
all of the browsers say,

1129
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:56,133
well, you know,
we've got this certificate,

1130
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:59,934
and it's unsigned, and it's,
you know, low security,

1131
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:01,434
and it doesn't really work.

1132
00:46:01,434 --> 00:46:04,200
Do you want to continue
putting your credit card number?

1133
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,501
What do we all do?

1134
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,033
Ian: Yes.
Charles: Yes.

1135
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,801
And we are the experts,
right?

1136
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:11,167
And we take this huge
backwards step.

1137
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:14,000
We have learned to do
the stupid thing.

1138
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,367
So we've got to figure out
as we get this right--

1139
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:19,334
We've got to figure out
how to do it

1140
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,267
in a way that teaches users

1141
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:24,400
and in a way that users
understand what they're doing.

1142
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,934
How to do the right thing.

1143
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:28,667
So the research is not
technology.

1144
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:31,801
The research and the development
is behavior.

1145
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:35,234
And the web is, you know,
a very, very big environment.

1146
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:37,367
Researching behavior

1147
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,434
and people's understanding
on the web,

1148
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:41,100
that's complicated stuff.

1149
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,133
And we're doing it.

1150
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,934
man: My question's regarding--

1151
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:46,734
with the increase in touch
and multi-touch

1152
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:48,133
as a user interface,

1153
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:52,467
not only for mobile devices,
but also laptops and computers,

1154
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,934
that has an implication for how
you might use the web browser,

1155
00:46:55,934 --> 00:46:58,567
the features of the web browser,
and how you might design for it.

1156
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:01,434
I mean, even with the iPhone,
it has multi-touch features,

1157
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:05,868
but it also stops it from doing
some other types of interface.

1158
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:09,133
I'd like to hear your comments
on what would you regard as

1159
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,367
sort of the best practice
for dealing with

1160
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,601
this sort of new touch
and multi-touch environment

1161
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:14,901
with user interface?

1162
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:18,901
Jonas: We've had recent
discussions with a vendor.

1163
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:21,367
I'm not sure if I can
tell you who.

1164
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:27,701
But about coming out with
DOM API's new standards

1165
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:31,200
for doing multi-touch,
and so on.

1166
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,367
One of the early problems
we discovered

1167
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:35,667
as we started doing
mobile stuff--

1168
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:38,567
this is a long time ago,
not the current effort--

1169
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:44,801
was that you went to Gmaps--
to Google Maps--

1170
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,801
and you wanted to scroll
on the map,

1171
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:48,133
instead of scrolling the map,

1172
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:49,968
what you ended up was
scrolling the page.

1173
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:56,434
And so there is a effort--
the DOM advanced effort--

1174
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:59,033
to try to standardize
this better.

1175
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:00,801
Because, like you say,
there's overlap

1176
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:05,767
in the various ways
you interact with the browser.

1177
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:10,534
And so it's not
a solved problem yet.

1178
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:13,400
There are various solutions,
and they are being debated.

1179
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,868
I haven't heard, like,
where that standard is--

1180
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:19,934
what the latest news
on that standard is.

1181
00:48:19,934 --> 00:48:22,467
But there's definitely
efforts there

1182
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,000
to sort of improve
the situation.

1183
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,200
Charles: The guy who's
supposed to be working on it

1184
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,067
is sitting over there hiding
instead.

1185
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:31,501
Jonas: So it's a very
hard problem to solve.

1186
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:33,968
Especially that fact that
today there are so many things

1187
00:48:33,968 --> 00:48:36,300
that want to react to, like,
on click.

1188
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,767
Whereas, if you're, like,
dragging on a touch interface,

1189
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,000
that is sort of a click,
but sort of not.

1190
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,067
And how does the page or browser
know which one you want to do?

1191
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:50,968
So I suspect that there is
slowly gonna come new standards

1192
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:52,434
to deal with this.

1193
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:56,734
And then, once the standards
have been slowly deployed,

1194
00:48:56,734 --> 00:49:00,334
websites will slowly start
to take advantage of them.

1195
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:04,300
The best help here is
gonna be

1196
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,400
when more people start
mobile browsing.

1197
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,667
So the more this turns into
an actual problem for people

1198
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,434
and for websites,

1199
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,901
the faster we'll find
a solution.

1200
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:16,334
Charles: Right, there's this
legacy of dirty, messy code

1201
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:18,701
that is causing problems.

1202
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,968
And everything we try and do
gets complicated

1203
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:23,734
by the fact that there's a whole
chunk of the web out there

1204
00:49:23,734 --> 00:49:27,567
that will break if we do
anything that seems intelligent.

1205
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:30,968
And so, you know, if you guys
go back and figure out

1206
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,100
how to clean up your stuff,
then that would be helpful.

1207
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,267
That would be a part
of the best practice

1208
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:40,300
that will enable us to build--
us all--

1209
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,834
because developers do
most of the thinking here--

1210
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:45,400
to build new best practices
and make things go.

1211
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,133
But interfaces change
all the time.

1212
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:51,667
Controlled interfaces--
touch and multi-touch

1213
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,667
and gravity stuff.

1214
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,267
And you go into
the accessibility world,

1215
00:49:56,267 --> 00:49:58,367
where you have people
with disabilities

1216
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:02,834
who've been using
brain-wave control, literally,

1217
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:08,467
and voice and multi-touch stuff
for years and decades.

1218
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,467
There's a lot
of this stuff around.

1219
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,968
It's about figuring out
how to integrate it.

1220
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,200
And it's really about, you know,
how can we clean up the way

1221
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,167
that people understand
the interaction piece

1222
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:24,267
of an application
so that we can make nicer code

1223
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:31,400
and nicer APIs available
without busting half the web?

1224
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,667
man: How do you see the future
and the role

1225
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:39,767
of browser extensions?

1226
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:42,734
Jonas: I think browser exten--

1227
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:46,033
I mean, to me,
the browser is really is your--

1228
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:47,367
Once you have installed
a browser,

1229
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:48,601
it's your piece of software.

1230
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:50,934
You should be able to do
whatever you want with it.

1231
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:53,801
And so the more powerful
extensions

1232
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,000
that are available
for that browser, the better.

1233
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,667
So I'm definitely very
pro browser and pro extensions.

1234
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:04,734
I mean, look at the extension
community we have for Firefox.

1235
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:05,934
It's really amazing.

1236
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:07,734
And I'm sure a good chunk
of the reason

1237
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,434
people switch to Firefox
is because

1238
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:10,868
there's some extension
that they want.

1239
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:15,801
The downside, or the other side
of that is security.

1240
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:21,167
We want people to be secure
at the same time.

1241
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,801
And the more sort of power
we give to extensions--

1242
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:26,501
the more things they can do,
the more awesome they get--

1243
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,868
the bigger the risk that
they do something evil and bad.

1244
00:51:29,868 --> 00:51:32,868
Or the risk that they have
some security problem in them,

1245
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:35,200
and someone hacks them,
and then you have full access

1246
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,734
to whatever power
that they had.

1247
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:41,567
So I definitely think
that extensions are

1248
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:43,501
a very good thing.

1249
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:46,434
And we just need to sort of--

1250
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:48,234
It's not a perfect system yet,

1251
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:50,367
and it's never gonna be
a perfect system.

1252
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:53,033
But we need to improve, and
we need to make it more secure

1253
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,901
and easier to deal with.

1254
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:59,033
The other side too is the
Greasemonkey-type extensions,

1255
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,000
where you actually extend
web pages.

1256
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,901
And that's one of the things,
I think,

1257
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:06,601
where HTML has really triumphed,

1258
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:08,367
in the sense that you could
never do something

1259
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:11,534
like Greasemonkey
for your desktop applications.

1260
00:52:11,534 --> 00:52:14,834
The applications I install
on my iPhone

1261
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:17,734
are never gonna have, like,
Greasemonkey plug-ins

1262
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,367
that allow me to, like,
improve the applications.

1263
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:23,167
But the websites I use are--

1264
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:28,734
The ecosystem around the web
is such that you can

1265
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:30,367
reach into various aspects.

1266
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:32,267
You can change the looks
of things.

1267
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:34,334
And you can also add
functionality,

1268
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:36,300
or change functionality
as you want.

1269
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,501
So that is a very
powerful thing of the web.

1270
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,000
And I think that's, uh...

1271
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,901
I don't know if it'll be
a major competitive advantage

1272
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:47,067
to the web, as opposed
to desktop applications,

1273
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,334
but it's definitely
something that,

1274
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,634
for the people that use it,
it's a very powerful thing.

1275
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:52,801
Ian: At the beginning
of the talk,

1276
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:55,467
we were talking about
how do you use a browser

1277
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:56,834
to decide what to implement?

1278
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:58,501
And I think it was Charles
who said, you know,

1279
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,701
if you go out there and you show
that there's a need for it,

1280
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:03,033
and a lot of people want it--
that will implement it--

1281
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,367
I think extensions provide a way
to show that need.

1282
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:10,701
A few years ago, when phishing
was just sort of entering

1283
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:12,300
the common vocabulary,

1284
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,767
Google went out and put on
an extension for Firefox--

1285
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:16,300
the Safe Browsing extension,

1286
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,000
which basically provided
warnings

1287
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,167
when you hit
a suspected phishing site.

1288
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:24,200
And now that functionality is
in all the browsers.

1289
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,067
Why? Because we showed
that we could do it.

1290
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:28,434
People started downloading it

1291
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:30,167
and showed that there was
a demand for it.

1292
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,868
And it was validated
as a reasonable idea.

1293
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:34,400
And so now it's one
of the standard things

1294
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,567
on most browsers.

1295
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:38,133
So I think extensions have
a great role

1296
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:41,434
in not only just customizing
your browser

1297
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:42,868
to meet your experience,

1298
00:53:42,868 --> 00:53:46,200
but also in validating that
something is a good idea

1299
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,634
for a browser, and that
there is demand for it,

1300
00:53:48,634 --> 00:53:49,667
and that it should become part

1301
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,434
of the standard
browsing experience.

1302
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:55,868
Charles: So extensibility
gives a community a chance

1303
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:59,100
to either show
where a browser should go,

1304
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,634
or take something--

1305
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:02,534
You know, a lot of the stuff
that we've done at Opera,

1306
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:05,601
that's like Mouse Gestures
and things we've had for ages--

1307
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:06,901
speed dials and stuff--

1308
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:10,467
people go and develop
as Firefox extensions.

1309
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:13,834
It gives you this quick way
of copying stuff,

1310
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,000
or of testing stuff out.

1311
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,400
It suffers from some drawbacks.

1312
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,400
You don't want
your core functionality

1313
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,901
to be based on, you know,
some chain of extensibility

1314
00:54:23,901 --> 00:54:28,701
because the inherent difference
in security and stuff.

1315
00:54:28,701 --> 00:54:31,968
So you want to use that
as a way seeing

1316
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,734
where people are going,
what's good

1317
00:54:34,734 --> 00:54:37,467
as a guide to, you know,
what should you bring in

1318
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,267
to the central core?

1319
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:43,968
But extensibility in general--
that's a programming paradigm.

1320
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:45,968
Helps people do stuff.

1321
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:50,467
man: Specifically, what
functional or design patents

1322
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:54,334
have inhibited, I guess, the
development and implementation

1323
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:58,234
of new browser standards?

1324
00:54:58,234 --> 00:55:00,534
Charles: You mean by number,
or just, like,

1325
00:55:00,534 --> 00:55:02,367
the author and date?
[chuckles]

1326
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:03,901
man: In general, I guess.

1327
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:07,033
What have you run into
where maybe Apple or Microsoft

1328
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:08,834
has said nope,
you can't do that,

1329
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:10,434
or do it differently?

1330
00:55:10,434 --> 00:55:14,234
Ian: I think some of your
question is alluding to, like,

1331
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:15,701
our people saying,
"No, don't do that."

1332
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:17,801
But I think a lot of it is
just practical constraints,

1333
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:19,200
at least on the Chrome side.

1334
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,367
We look at things like
Web Workers.

1335
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,968
And it seems like
that should be so trivial

1336
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:26,467
to implement in Chrome.

1337
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:29,467
But then we hit
all these issues like, you know,

1338
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,968
to do XHR from a Worker,

1339
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:35,367
you need to know the origin
of the request.

1340
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:36,667
A simple thing.

1341
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,868
But when you're
in multiprocess land,

1342
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,300
like you are in Chrome,

1343
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,100
you are in a separate process.

1344
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,167
You might not actually
have access to that data.

1345
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:46,734
So on the Chrome side,
we actually hit

1346
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:49,534
a lot of these practical
considerations that--

1347
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,400
You know, before we released,

1348
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,000
people developing
these standards

1349
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,968
weren't necessarily thinking,
you know,

1350
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:56,467
how is this actually gonna
play out

1351
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,400
in a multiprocess environment?

1352
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,200
And now people are actually
starting to think about that.

1353
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,868
And so that's--

1354
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:04,801
I don't know if that's
functional or--

1355
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,467
That's one of the things
that is certainly interesting

1356
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:10,767
from my perspective in terms
of things that sound like

1357
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:11,901
they should be easy,

1358
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,033
but actually turn out
to be quite hard.

1359
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:17,567
Charles: Was your question
about patterns or patents?

1360
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,000
man: "Patents."
Charles: Oh, patents.

1361
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,234
man: Yes,
like registered patents.

1362
00:56:22,234 --> 00:56:27,267
Jonas: Well, the first thing
I think when you say patents

1363
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:28,601
is video.

1364
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:31,100
The video situation right now
is really, really bad

1365
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,567
in the sense that
there's all sort

1366
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:35,000
of ridiculous patents
out there.

1367
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,767
And the most popular format,

1368
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:39,400
and arguably
a very good format, is H264.

1369
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,901
We just can't use because
there's patents on it.

1370
00:56:41,901 --> 00:56:43,501
There's just no way.

1371
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,934
And we would love to do it.
There's code out there.

1372
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:47,734
There's open-source code
out there.

1373
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:50,167
We could just, you know,
plug it in.

1374
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:52,934
But we can't, technically
and financially, do it

1375
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:54,534
because of patents.

1376
00:56:54,534 --> 00:57:00,367
And similarly...

1377
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:04,200
everything around video is
so heavily patented

1378
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,901
that Apple has said that, well,
OGG looks decent enough.

1379
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:12,234
But if we implement it,
we have no idea

1380
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:14,434
if we're gonna get sued
because it's very likely

1381
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,934
that there's a patent somewhere
that no one has thought about,

1382
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,701
or that might be
a submarine patent

1383
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,200
that no one knows about yet.

1384
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,300
And so they just, out of fear
of getting sued,

1385
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,234
they don't want to implement it.

1386
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:29,300
No one knows to a patent,
but just, it's--

1387
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,133
There's probably a patent,
or quite possibly a patent.

1388
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:36,534
man: Do you see a solution
for these kind of problems?

1389
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:40,067
Charles: So walking into any
new area of technology--

1390
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:43,100
Every time the web goes into
some new area of technology,

1391
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,734
you find that
in most areas of technology

1392
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:48,400
there are patents.

1393
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,300
And some companies,
you know--

1394
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,601
I don't know of Microsoft
holding a patent

1395
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:57,567
over anybody to stop development
of the web at any time ever.

1396
00:57:57,567 --> 00:58:02,834
And I do know of them,
before the W3C patent policy--

1397
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:05,567
which was a fairly radical step
of saying, you know,

1398
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:08,167
"We want people to make
a royalty-free web.

1399
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:11,133
We want the stuff to be
patent-free, if we can."

1400
00:58:11,133 --> 00:58:13,300
Microsoft voluntarily stepped up
and said

1401
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,634
we've got this patent,
and we will put it down

1402
00:58:15,634 --> 00:58:17,767
on the conditions which are
what are now

1403
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:19,667
the W3C conditions.

1404
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:23,934
In things like Voice, you know,
going into Voice.

1405
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:27,834
In, as Jonas said, 
video is a minefield.

1406
00:58:27,834 --> 00:58:32,567
Going into a couple of areas,
there have been patents.

1407
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:37,901
Apple is currently excluding
a patent on the widget space.

1408
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:42,234
And, you know, the solution is
that we sit down

1409
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:45,667
and we look--
either with the patent holder--

1410
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,534
You know, because
people file patents,

1411
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:50,634
and it costs them money,
and they do have a right to say

1412
00:58:50,634 --> 00:58:52,634
I want to actually recoup
some of the money

1413
00:58:52,634 --> 00:58:54,234
I got from this work.

1414
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:57,167
But you can either sit down
with the patent holder

1415
00:58:57,167 --> 00:59:01,467
and say, well, all right,
if we're going to do this,

1416
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:04,100
either we agree
to all pay up money--

1417
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:07,934
And in the W3C world,
that's not an answer.

1418
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:10,100
It's like, we've gotta
figure out a way around it.

1419
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,767
So Apple can come and help us
work out

1420
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,968
how to avoid infringing
their patent,

1421
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,734
and still provide
a functionality

1422
00:59:16,734 --> 00:59:19,334
that's the thing
we were aiming at.

1423
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:22,767
Or we go out to the community
and say, look, you know,

1424
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,467
we're not getting anywhere.

1425
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:27,033
We've gotta figure this out
as a community,

1426
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:28,868
and it's a big,
complicated process.

1427
00:59:28,868 --> 00:59:32,434
It's like, what is the history
behind this patent?

1428
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:36,934
What other patents are out there
that might cover something--

1429
00:59:36,934 --> 00:59:40,934
An expired patent that covers
similar stuff that we could use.

1430
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:44,801
Or some prior art
that shows the patent holder

1431
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,834
that actually it's not really
worth their while

1432
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,334
enforcing this.

1433
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:51,901
And in the past, in some cases,
that's what's happened.

1434
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:54,567
That someone has said
we've got patents on,

1435
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:57,300
you know, this sort of
scene-updating technology

1436
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,701
or something.

1437
00:59:58,701 --> 01:00:01,801
And we sit down,
and we can't make any headway,

1438
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:03,234
and we go out and start
looking around,

1439
01:00:03,234 --> 01:00:04,400
and people say,
"Wait a minute.

1440
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,000
You got the patent, but like,
ten years before

1441
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,300
you ever applied for it,

1442
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,300
there were 15 applications
doing it."

1443
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,400
And the patent holder looks at
it and says "Yeah, you're right.

1444
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,000
Don't worry about it.
Just go ahead and use it."

1445
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,467
Schroepfer: So we're
just about out of time.

1446
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:18,601
Or, we are out of time.

1447
01:00:18,601 --> 01:00:20,267
Quick closing remarks
from each of you.

1448
01:00:20,267 --> 01:00:21,534
We'll start with you, Ian.

1449
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,601
Any thoughts you have
for the audience?

1450
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:26,467
Ian: I just--I'm very excited
by the direction

1451
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,834
that browsers are going.

1452
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:30,601
I think all the browsers,
both onstage and offstage,

1453
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:32,467
are getting better.

1454
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,100
And I know that we're all
very motivated

1455
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,000
to continue that direction.

1456
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,901
We're all providing a lot
of new functionality.

1457
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:39,968
I hope that you all
in the audience

1458
01:00:39,968 --> 01:00:42,667
start taking advantage of it
and certainly give us feedback.

1459
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:44,667
And, you know,
if there's a direction

1460
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,901
that you think that we should be
going in that we're not,

1461
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:49,100
let us know.

1462
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:54,400
Jonas: Yeah, I'm very excited
that the web has changed a lot

1463
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,667
over the past few years.

1464
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,267
Just a few years ago,
nothing was basically happening.

1465
01:00:58,267 --> 01:01:00,734
The web had looked the same
for a few years,

1466
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:03,334
and there was no new,
significant innovation.

1467
01:01:03,334 --> 01:01:07,167
And now we have, what,
five major browsers

1468
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:11,067
that are very heavily
competing with each other.

1469
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,734
And just the improvements
that's happened in JavaScript

1470
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:17,901
are very sort of indicative
of how much competition

1471
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:19,501
and how much improvement
we're actually seeing.

1472
01:01:19,501 --> 01:01:22,701
So I'm very excited
to be part of this.

1473
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,501
Charles: So it's exciting.

1474
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:27,968
It's like, you know,
we're in this brave new world.

1475
01:01:27,968 --> 01:01:30,868
One of the things
that I see more of,

1476
01:01:30,868 --> 01:01:33,834
and would like to see a lot
more of, is professionalism.

1477
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:37,701
Let's get together, and let's
do our work on our own

1478
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:39,701
and make it better,
you know.

1479
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:42,667
Because the web started off
being a bunch of cowboys

1480
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,567
and a bunch of crazy people
doing stuff

1481
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,300
and just lashing it up.

1482
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,300
And there is a place for that.

1483
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,234
And we should all remember
that if you don't do that,

1484
01:01:51,234 --> 01:01:52,868
you stagnate and get bored

1485
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:56,200
and go off and become a mechanic
or a plumber or something.

1486
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,200
But there is also a place
for being professional

1487
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,868
and caring about quality,

1488
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:04,667
and caring about
maintaining stuff.

1489
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,734
Thinking about stuff
that's gonna be around

1490
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:10,300
when you're not working on it
anymore, and where it goes.

1491
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,701
And, you know, I see that there
is a whole lot more of that.

1492
01:02:14,701 --> 01:02:17,400
And I'd like to see
even more.

1493
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,567
The browsers are getting better.

1494
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:22,300
I mean, browsers used to be
this sort of crazy project

1495
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,834
that you'd lash together.

1496
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:26,801
Now they're turning into
an important piece of software,

1497
01:02:26,801 --> 01:02:28,767
and we're working harder
on making it

1498
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:30,434
a really good piece
of software.

1499
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:32,133
The developers are
getting better.

1500
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:33,901
Developers are actually
thinking harder about

1501
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,767
what impact they have,

1502
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:38,934
and what impact it has
when they do a good job.

1503
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:42,501
And what impact it has
when they think about stuff

1504
01:02:42,501 --> 01:02:46,000
that's gonna be, maybe, around
for a long time.

1505
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,934
Or how they're gonna change it

1506
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:50,801
so that their embarrassing
first effort--

1507
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:53,767
which is always my case--
doesn't stick around.

1508
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:56,634
But it gets replaced
by something cleaner and better.

1509
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:57,968
It's fun.
Schroepfer: Great.

1510
01:02:57,968 --> 01:03:00,300
I want to thank the panel
for great thoughts

1511
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,501
on browser futures.

1512
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:02,567
Thank you very much.

1513
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:06,834
[applause]
