1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,485

2
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:02,070
JONATHAN: to this week's
office hours.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,700

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,510
I'm joined by Wolff Dobson.

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,080
My name is Jonathan Beri.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,070
And our guests today are Gerwin
and Sigfried, some guys

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,990
you may have seen before.

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,660
Hey, guys.

9
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,912
GERWIN: Hi.

10
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:17,820
SIEGFRIED: Hi.

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,800
JONATHAN: So if you've been
following our blog, our Plus

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,750
pages, our own stream, you know
that we released Google+

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,980
[? ingrown ?] apps.

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,962
GERWIN: Yay.

15
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,272
JONATHAN: General--

16
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:31,995
Yes.

17
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:35,460
But today's topic, we will be
talking about what we released

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,060
to developers, some new end
user features and any

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,770
questions that we have from
our guests, as well as the

20
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,360
original announcement plus
those this morning.

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,400
So if you have questions, and
you're watching live stream,

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
go ahead and ask it there.

23
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,010
Before we go into the technical
piece about the

24
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,455
features being launched, we
will say that it's being

25
00:00:57,455 --> 00:00:59,630
released slowly over
the course today.

26
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,270
So if you don't see anything in
apps in your hangouts yet,

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,730
you will by the end
of the day.

28
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,250
Cool, so let's start with
our new developer site.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,060
So we--

30
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,830
WOLFF: Well, actually, I think
we should start with apps.

31
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,080
JONATHAN: Our apps.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,200

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,005
WOLFF: Our guests, have you
guys seen the new app

34
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,502
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
and everything.

35
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:25,270
SIEGFRIED: Not live yet.

36
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,970
WOLFF: Not yet.

37
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,540
Yeah, I noticed we don't
have it here.

38
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,850
As Jonathan said, we're
rolling it out slowly.

39
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,650
It's pretty neat.

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,834
We've got [? topher ?]
on there.

41
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:39,870
We've got some shared
collaboration

42
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,630
stuff like slide share.

43
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,880
JONATHAN: Thank you.

44
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,470
WOLFF: So yeah, a lot
of new partners.

46
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,000
I really hope everybody has
a chance to play with it.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,346
JONATHAN: Yes, there are
some photos in the

48
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:56,844
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

49
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:57,840
So you can see it.

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,235
WOLFF: Yeah, so take a look.

51
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,780
Take a look under
[? the development tool. ?]

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,865
JONATHAN: So for the end user
features, we now have the

53
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:08,910
ability to take from an app of
one of our feature partners to

54
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,140
go back to any recently used
apps, an ability to toggle on

55
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,593
and off apps and a new feature
which we added.

56
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,510
It's called Extensions, and
we're going to go into that a

57
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:18,630
little bit.

58
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,780
WOLFF: We're going to talk
about what those are.

59
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,370
JONATHAN: But those are
different ways to interact.

60
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,972
And of course, the other
end user feature is the

61
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,400
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] button, which
we're going to go into how to

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
make and how to use in your
site a little later.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,761
So the general workflow is
somebody would like to use an

64
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,845
app, a hangout, and there's an
app in it, you can certainly

65
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:38,940
use the application together.

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,412
Or you can launch a hangout
button on your site and go

67
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:44,800
right to the app.

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,930
WOLFF: We have examples of that
in the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

69
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,800
So first thing obviously,
we have some pictures of

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,180
collaborating together.

71
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,220
We have a picture of the first
extension, which is the

72
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,396
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] tab.

73
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:04,010
But what I'd like to talk about
right now is one of the

74
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,160
big features is you
can now shift your

75
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,890
hangout apps from public.

76
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,430
And we want to talk about
how you do that.

77
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,930
So why don't you click on
Publishing Apps right now.

78
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,750
Or should we start with--?

79
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,570
JONATHAN: Let's just
[INAUDIBLE].

80
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,526
WOLFF: Well, click on Publishing
Apps to make sure I

81
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:25,776
[INAUDIBLE] here.

82
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:28,370

83
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,980
Yeah, let's just go
there [INAUDIBLE].

84
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,180
JONATHAN: Great.

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,920
WOLFF: So if you go to--
so Create A New

86
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,220
Hangout App, please.

87
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,470
JONATHAN: Hangout app.

88
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,080

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,330
WOLFF: [INAUDIBLE] awesome.

90
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,010

91
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,459
Then go ahead and throw in
hangouts, what you always do.

92
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,350

93
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,350
Now, go click on Hangouts.

94
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,160
And when you look into Hangouts,
you have a lot of

95
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,890
new [? features. ?]

96
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,420
And you can see those
now, I believe.

97
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,340
So of you scroll down a little
bit, the first section there

98
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,740
is just where [INAUDIBLE].

99
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,773
We [? do ?] you a section where
it shows you the title

100
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:20,683
of your apps, and that's
the move here in the

101
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:21,170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

102
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,730
It's also in the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

103
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:22,970
while you're loading.

104
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,230
So take something nice
besides hangout app.

105
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,140
Now, the next section there,
is your hangout

106
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,762
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] an extension?

107
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:33,900
And it goes into a little bit
more detail there, but it's

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,400
basically an app that appears in
the leftmost 300 pixels of

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,390
your screen.

110
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,430
So we've released a single
extension so far, which will

111
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,967
be the Fx app, which allows
you to have more elaborate

112
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:49,580
decorations.

113
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,839
But the idea is that it's
for something for

114
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,840
[? trying out ?], people
cracking dice in a role

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,640
playing game.

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,830
JONATHAN: Like a note-taking
app.

117
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,755
WOLFF: Yeah, something
like that.

118
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:05,590
It basically takes the place
where the testing

119
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,990
[? moment is. ?]

120
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,887
If you check extension and you
weren't in Dev console, it

121
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:14,890
will look like a regular app
right now because we don't yet

122
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,290
have an extension pane
in the hangout.

123
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,212
But it's OK, because once you
go public, it actually will

124
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:24,720
appear in the extension place.

125
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,900
JONATHAN: So that's actually
an important thing to note.

126
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,283
Right now, the apps and the
extensions, from an API point

127
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:32,240
of view, are the same.

128
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
And so all the APIs that you
have within an app, you have

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,700
within your extension.

130
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,800
WOLFF: And the shared state--

131
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,030
if two people are running that
extension, that will be

132
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,140
sharing state.

133
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,390
You can actually have two
apps running now.

134
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,315
You can have the extension and
the regular app, and the

135
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:47,440
extension will share
a state with other

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,610
extensions of the same kind.

137
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,131
So if two people are in the same
extension, they'll share

138
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,140
a state together.

139
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,060
JONATHAN: [INAUDIBLE]

140
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,620
WOLFF: And the main page app
will have shared state with

141
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,920
your other main page apps of
the same types, but they do

142
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,570
not communicate with
each other.

143
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,536
And in fact, you can't
even tell if one or

144
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:07,980
the other is running.

145
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,990
JONATHAN: Right.

146
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,850
So to sum it up, you can
actually have a hangout

147
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,050
without an app, with an app,
with an extension, and with an

148
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,300
app and an extension.

149
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,016
WOLFF: 0, 1, 11, and 0.

150
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,720
JONATHAN: There are those
who can count in binary.

151
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,350
WOLFF: And those who can't.

152
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,370
JONATHAN: Something.

153
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,794
WOLFF: There are ten
kinds of people.

154
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:28,778
There's [? import binary ?]

155
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,270
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

156
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,520
JONATHAN: That's it.

157
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,510

158
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,840
WOLFF: OK, so anyway, like I
said, if you click that right

159
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,980
now, it'll tell the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] server that

160
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,560
you want to share this
as an extension.

161
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,650
It will have no effect when
you're in what we're calling

162
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,070
developer sandbox, which is
[? hanging out with ?]

163
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,410
the API to talk [INAUDIBLE].

164
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,450
If you're running against
production, which is

165
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,540
+.google.com/hangouts, then it
will appear as an extension.

166
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,843
However, you can't run it
against production unless you

167
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:03,752
publish it.

168
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:05,170
So let's talk about
publishing.

169
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,450
JONATHAN: One more thing about
extensions before we move on.

170
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,910
When you flip that bit, the only
thing that does change is

171
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,980
the size the icons that
are required.

172
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,876
So if you notice that--

173
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,150
if our machine would match up.

174
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,590
There you go.

175
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,750
It's a different size because
it's where we place the

176
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,210
extension launcher.

177
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,910
WOLFF: Yeah, the extension
launcher is more on the top

178
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,140
bar where the little dog face
and everything were before,

179
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,505
and then the apps actually
run in the base.

180
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,150
So yeah, Jonathan's
going to show you.

181
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,670
JONATHAN: So this is a screen
shot of what it looks like.

182
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,790
WOLFF: Give them
one more take.

183
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,610
So if you look here next to
screen share, there's a little

184
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,530
icon there.

185
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,640
That's what extensions are.

186
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,813
When you click that, it's going
to show an extension.

187
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:52,216
That's where the icon
is going to be.

188
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:55,474
We do provide a default icon,
but it's not nearly as cool as

189
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,400
the icon you can pick out.

190
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,670
So you should definitely
put your own icons up.

191
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,570
And actually, go back and
show the apps up here.

192
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:04,960
JONATHAN: Oh, yes.

193
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,624
WOLFF: So if you go
down and look at--

194
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:10,620
JONATHAN: Do we have a screen
shot of the App switcher?

195
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,450

196
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,402
WOLFF: Well anyway, in the
App switcher, you'll

197
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:23,390
see this big grid.

198
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,640
Probably,
[? you're not running that. ?]

199
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,140

200
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,640
Go down.

201
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,140
Go down.

202
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,640
Go down.

203
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Go down.

204
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,220
Nope.

205
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,734
Sorry, it's in the
[? Public here. ?]

206
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:34,700
This is my last offer.

207
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,685
JONATHAN: Some of this was
written very recently.

208
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,720
JONATHAN: Possibly
the last minute.

209
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,330
So right, so scroll
up a little bit.

210
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,910
That's a picture of the App
switcher right there.

211
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,040
That's where your icons
are going to appear.

212
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,255
It looks like the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] when you

213
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:49,930
mouse over it.

214
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,060
And the thing goes up and
down to show your

215
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,360
description, very cool.

216
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,900
JONATHAN: And this grid that
we actually mention here is

217
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,732
the selector, [? cursor ?]
feature and most

218
00:08:58,732 --> 00:08:59,850
recently used as well.

219
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,660
We don't have a screen
shot for you.

220
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,790
WOLFF: OK, so going back
to the console.

221
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,900
So anyway, put URLs to
your icons there.

222
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,218
If you put bogus URLs in,
then it will just put

223
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,340
the defaults there.

224
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,190
So again, be cool.

225
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,495
The black and white one
is for mouse down.

226
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:20,150

227
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,940
Application description,
right.

228
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,480
So the application description
will appear.

229
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,240
If you've ever been to the
current web store, you have

230
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,980
those little squares.

231
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,865
When you mouse over them, a
little white thing goes up and

232
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:29,100
says, I want to use this app.

233
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,700
And then there's a little
one-sentence description.

234
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,065
Again, feel free to sell you
app in there, make it look

235
00:09:37,065 --> 00:09:39,320
like it's fun to use.

236
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,540
JONATHAN: By selling, make
people want to install it.

237
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,520
WOLFF: Yes, exactly.

238
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,570
Then down in Support, you need
a terms of service you need a

239
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,188
privacy policy, and you
need some way for

240
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,590
Google to contact you.

241
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,740
JONATHAN: And these
are all URLs.

242
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,220
Emails are not sufficient.

243
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,190
And I think Gerwin had a
question before we started

244
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,300
about terms of service
and privacy policy.

245
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,166
GERWIN: Yes.

246
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:09,020
JONATHAN: And so the best
answer I can give you is

247
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,296
because we can't provide Google
service, terms of

248
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:17,010
service and privacy policy vary
from country to country.

249
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,040
And also, depending on
the industry, how you

250
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,270
want to word that.

251
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,780
So if you're going to publish
an app, you should have your

252
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,270
terms of service and privacy
policy reviewed by somebody

253
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,665
who will provide Google
authority for the countries

254
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:29,365
you want to operate in.

255
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,755
GERWIN: OK.

256
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,490
JONATHAN: Outside of that,
anything I say is just

257
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,800
conjecture and what I observe.

258
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,970
Just make sure, especially on
the privacy policy, which I

259
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,580
care more about-- maybe less for
the legal-- is be upfront

260
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,410
with your users.

261
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,410
So what you do with their data
is very important, and make

262
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,890
sure they know what you're
doing with their data.

263
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,650
How legalese you want to make
it, that's really up to you

264
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,140
and your legalese.

265
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,724
WOLFF: But you need to tell them
what you're going to do,

266
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:03,186
and that's what we're
looking for.

267
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:05,835
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE] contact,
we want [? a page. ?]

268
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:09,120
Hopefully, it'll have email or
a way to post or [INAUDIBLE]

269
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,050
JONATHAN: Even something as
simple as your + page-- if you

270
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,507
feel that's the right way for
them to contact you-- if we

271
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,881
create a + page for you app,
that could be sufficient.

272
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:20,360
JONATHAN: Make a + page
for your app.

273
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,850
Lastly, you have this
check box here,

274
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,440
which is Make Public.

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,750
And Make Public says make
your application

276
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,800
available to all users.

277
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,840
If this box is unchecked, it's
going to work the way it has

278
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,590
worked in Developer
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] until now,

279
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,332
which is only people who are
in your Teams list--

280
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:39,650
up there on the left--

281
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,970
only people on your Teams list
are going to be able to see

282
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,070
the app at all.

283
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,740
They are the only people who
know that it exists.

284
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,910
If you try to bring somebody
in, they won't be able to

285
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,590
install it.

286
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,570
If you click Make Public,
everybody in the world, if

287
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,150
they have your product ID, which
is that number up in the

288
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,660
thing, if they have their
product ID, they'll

289
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,930
be able to run it.

290
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,570
And keep that in mind.

291
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,270

292
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,650
We ask you to make two steps.

293
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,950
The first is that you make
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

294
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,340
ID because as you will notice
when you are running outside

295
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,590
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]--

296
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,060

297
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,913
actually, if you've created an
[? planet ID ?] for your app,

298
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:23,810
Google will now ask you, when
you begin running the app, for

299
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,680
permission.

300
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,730
Actually, a permission
box pops up before

301
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,210
the app begins running.

302
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,160
And it asks for exactly
three strokes.

303
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,430
There are two hangout strokes
that are basically--

304
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,550
this app may or may not
use your camera.

305
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,240
One of them is Plus Me.

306
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,530
Google needs to know
who you are.

307
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,570
Or rather, the app is going
to know who you are.

308
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,830
And the last one is
more [INAUDIBLE].

309
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,555
JONATHAN: Yes, that's correct.

310
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,500
WOLFF: So anyway, it'll
ask for these strokes.

311
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,350
Those three strokes actually
mean that you are now

312
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,155
authenticated, which means if
you used the authentication

313
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:07,650
sample that I [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
a while back, which is now

314
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,510
[INAUDIBLE], you'll be able to
get a token without actually

315
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,330
popping up a box, which
is pretty neat.

316
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,406
JONATHAN: So that means that
the JavaScript client, the

317
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:19,595
Google API JavaScript client,
which is in alpha still, you

318
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:22,870
can actually use that within
a hangout to call [? OA ?]

319
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,765
endpoints for all
the Google APIs.

320
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,880

321
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,724
WOLFF: You can get a [? OA2 ?]
client access hookup.

322
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,380
[INAUDIBLE].

323
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:34,980
And that's big.

324
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,122
That means that it's built
into the apps.

325
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,645

326
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:46,380
It's making upfront to the user
what you're going to be

327
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,460
doing in your app.

328
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,120
It's pretty cool.

329
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,640
JONATHAN: That's the first
requirement form.

330
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,040
WOLFF: First step is that
you go and you click

331
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,932
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

332
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,865
GERWIN: Yeah, so can I ask
just a short question?

333
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:57,280
WOLFF: Sure.

334
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,600
GERWIN: So usually, when you
make a client, you have to

335
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,950
provide the callback URL and
admit its sources for the

336
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,570
JavaScript.

337
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,720
Is there something special you
have to take care of when you

338
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,750
want to use the client ID for
the hangout apps, or do you

339
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,260
take care of this yourself?

340
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,390
WOLFF: That's a great
question.

341
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,780
I'll repeat it.

342
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,690
So the question is, what's a
callback URL for a client ID

343
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,670
that's running inside
a hangout?

344
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,516
Is that right?

345
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:23,483
GERWIN: Yes, exactly.

346
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:26,850
WOLFF: And the answer is, you
don't have to fill that out.

347
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,810
GERWIN: OK.

348
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,000
WOLFF: You can just leave it
as example.com, as long as

349
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,910
you're running it at hangout.

350
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,110
And the reason for
that is because--

351
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,230
well, it's long-winded--

352
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,210
but basically, the gadget server
knows that you are

353
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,690
running the authenticated
service inside this I-frame

354
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,100
and will take care of the
redirect for you.

355
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,880
GERWIN: OK, perfect.

356
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,640
WOLFF: It's also why you, as
we'll discover in the Docs,

357
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,180
actually don't need to send in
your APIP because again, the

358
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,530
gadget server and the RPC
services will re-write your

359
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,410
client ID because it knows
exactly who you are because

360
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,440
you're already [? authorized. ?]

361
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,300
We know who you are.

362
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,406
JONATHAN: By doing the
rewriting, we can keep it

363
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,516
secure without--

364
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:10,145
WOLFF: Yes, it means people
again aren't reading your

365
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:10,967
client ID off your page.

366
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,210
JONATHAN: Exactly.

367
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,190
WOLFF: It's win.

368
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,595
So again, that's all
you have to do.

369
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,380
You just have to type in your
project name and that's what's

370
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,520
going to appear in the pop-up.

371
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,236
And you can provide your
pictures and stuff if you go

372
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,326
back-- oh, you missed
[INAUDIBLE].

373
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,110
Oh, there we go.

374
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,180
Right, if you put your product
logo and your product name,

375
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,320
then that's what's going to
pop up in the in the OAuth

376
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,550
dialogue, but all you
really have to do is

377
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,480
have a produce table.

378
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,140
I mean we encourage product
logos, but cool.

379
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,240
And then here, just pick
Web Application and hit

380
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,920
[? Great Plan ID. ?]

381
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,210
You don't have to worry about
the redirect URI or the

382
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,532
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

383
00:15:46,532 --> 00:15:48,480
GERWIN: OK perfect.

384
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,900
WOLFF: Then go back.

385
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,980
So now, he's created
a client ID.

386
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,550
Last thin you have to do--

387
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,490
and this guy has already
done it.

388
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,740
Last thing we ask, if you're
going to make an app public,

389
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,262
we want you to register as a
Chrome Web Store developer

390
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,490
JONATHAN: And so you only
have to do this once.

391
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,970
WOLFF: Yes, only once, and you
actually don't have to upload

392
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,475
anything directly to the
Chrome web store.

393
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:12,960
All we ask is that you

394
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,270
register as a Chrome developer.

395
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,012
JONATHAN: And if you've
registered in the past, you

396
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:18,640
don't have to register again.

397
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:18,840
WOLFF: Yes.

398
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,190
If you've already verified,
you're verified.

399
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,920
It's fine.

400
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,570
What we need you to do, there's
a link off the page in

401
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,710
the cases where you
do have it.

402
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,500
Follow that link.

403
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Say yes, I want to sign up.

404
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,740
Then go to this dashboard page,
and if you've never

405
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,026
verified before, the
verification is a $5 fee.

406
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,860
JONATHAN: I think in
most countries.

407
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,420
WOLFF: At least in the
United States.

408
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,380
In Mountain View, it's $5, which
is just a one time fee

409
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,470
to make sure that you are who
you say you are, more or less.

410
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,750
And after that, you
can publish as

411
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,390
many apps as you want.

412
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,630
And only one developer on your
team needs to be a Chrome web

413
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,940
store-verified person.

414
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,066
And to emphasize again, you
only need to be a verified

415
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,970
Chrome developer if you
plan to go public.

416
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,796
JONATHAN: Yes.

417
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,440
WOLFF: If you don't want to go
public, don't need to do it.

418
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,849
JONATHAN: So if you're a
university student, and you're

419
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,440
working on this for a project,
you may not have to even worry

420
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,390
about the--

421
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,630
WOLFF: Yes, you won't have to
worry about that unless you

422
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,800
want to make it public.

423
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,680
If you're just doing a demo or
a hackathon, that's fine.

424
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,755
So after that, hit Save, and
then, you will get a--

425
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,430
JONATHAN: I don't have
any content.

426
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,120
WOLFF: You don't have an HML.

427
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,025
And then you'll get your Enter
Hangout [? lid. ?]

428
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,486
Now go back.

429
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,200
Do you have an app
open on there?

430
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,910
[INAUDIBLE].

431
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,450
JONATHAN: Oh yeah, I do.

432
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,500
WOLFF: Yeah, just get it back.

433
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,380
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about that URL because

434
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,370
this is also exciting.

435
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,310
So if you look, that Enter
Hangout [? lid ?]

436
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,490
links to Hangouts API, to [?
hangoutsapi.bandit.google.com

437
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,640
?] or something a
lot like that.

438
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,100
And that goes to the
sandbox server.

439
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,900
And we talked about
this before.

440
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,210
The production server is
plus.google.com/hangouts.

441
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,660
Even after you make it public,
this will still go to the

442
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,720
development server.

443
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,996
You have to construct the URL
yourself to get to the--

444
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:20,960
JONATHAN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

445
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,730
WOLFF: Right.

446
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,476
And then can you show
an example of the--

447
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,190
well, we'll do it on
the other page.

448
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,230
So great.

449
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,120
So there you go.

450
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,540
So that's what you need to know

451
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,306
about the new Dev console.

452
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:36,010
If you get invalid input, which
will appear at the top

453
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,650
if you get some of your stuff
wrong, which means that some

454
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,990
of your fields aren't exactly
the way it was in [? Forms. ?]

455
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,520
Also, one last thing.

456
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,870
Let's say you have an app that's
public, and you don't

457
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,510
want it to be public anymore.

458
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:57,470
Anybody who has ownership
rights may unclick that

459
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,110
rights, whether or not
they're a registered,

460
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,690
verified Chrome developer.

461
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,650
However, only registered Chrome
developers can make it

462
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,920
back public again.

463
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,490
JONATHAN: So some of the reasons
why you'd want to

464
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,220
remove the public feature
of your app.

465
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,280
If there's an issue, and it's
affecting all users, and you

466
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
can't push it live is a reason
you would take it down.

467
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,530
This is one reason.

468
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,970
If there's some content issue
or issues such as user

469
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,150
complaints, you'd want to
take that down as well.

470
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,600
So take advantage of that
feature in those instances.

471
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,929
WOLFF: Or you just
want to retool.

472
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,150
You have a more awesome idea.

473
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,700
Then the last thing is about--

474
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,780
shoot, I can't remember where
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] is.

475
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:48,100
Oh, right, and as usually, if
you try to go to a hangout

476
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,936
app, and it's not public, and
you aren't a member of that

477
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:53,380
team on production--

478
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,380
if you go to a hangout app on
production that's not public,

479
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,630
it just won't let you.

480
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,420
And you'll just be in
a regular hangout.

481
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,600
JONATHAN: This is true.

482
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,870
WOLFF: Now you know.

483
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,853
JONATHAN: So we went over--

484
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,460
WOLFF: The new Dev console.

485
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,425
JONATHAN: We went over the new
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] or end users

486
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:11,132
the new Dev console.

487
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:15,790
WOLFF: Also to talk about is--

488
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,790
JONATHAN: We talked about
[? OA ?] a little bit.

489
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,426
WOLFF: Yeah.

490
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,794
We basically went through--

491
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,080
oh, let's talk about
extensions.

492
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,740
JONATHAN: Oh, extensions,
great.

493
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,070
WOLFF: So, going to
the sample apps.

494
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,730
JONATHAN: Sample apps.

495
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,470
WOLFF: OK, so actually, I'm
going to interrupt and talk

496
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,020
about buttons for
just a second.

497
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,610
You notice on this page,
we now have this

498
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,390
cool red hangout button?

499
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,276
That--

500
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:39,946
hello, Gerwin, again.

501
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:43,360
That hangout, that button
is a link to

502
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,620
plus.google.com out here.

503
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,830
Let's go to buttons
real quick.

504
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,085
I need a button.

505
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,582
No, it's right there.

506
00:20:53,582 --> 00:20:55,080
JONATHAN: Oh, sorry.

507
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,060
Maybe you should have
pushed the button.

508
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,575
WOLFF: Right, so we need your
app ID, which you get off of

509
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:03,645
the Dev console.

510
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:04,893
It's in the URL.

511
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:06,160
It's the Project
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

512
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,910
12 or 13 or 14, whatever
it is.

513
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,130
And basically, all you need
to do is attach it to

514
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,811
hangouts.api.tal
kgadget.google.com/hangouts.

515
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:19,500
That's going to go to
the sandbox server.

516
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,230
And when you want to
release, you go to

517
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,568
plus.google.com/hangouts.

518
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:28,730
We give you example buttons
in four exciting sizes.

519
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,000
We absolutely encourage
you to use these.

520
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,205
The images themselves are served
off of plus.google.com,

521
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:37,710
so they're actually
[INAUDIBLE].

522
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,920
JONATHAN: Yeah, so if there's
ever a change or an issue,

523
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,145
that's the best way to get
the up to date button.

524
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:45,550
And also, we serve it off
of RCBN so it's faster.

525
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,160
WOLFF: It's going to
be super fast.

526
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,780
JONATHAN: Also if you notice,
some of the dimensions

527
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,060
height-wise line up with
some of our other

528
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,368
buttons and the badges.

529
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:55,742
So we can line them up.

530
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:58,890

531
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,620
WOLFF: So anyway, going back
to the sample apps.

532
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,770
So that's how you
make a button.

533
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,300
Please make buttons in
the sample apps.

534
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,610
So these are our sample
apps we have

535
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,120
previous to this launch.

536
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,120
However, if you go into simple
hangout app, that one is a new

537
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,062
one that I made, which is as
small a hangout app as I could

538
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,600
possibly make that still
did something.

539
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,440
JONATHAN: Want to view the
source real quickly?

540
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,850
WOLFF: Sure.

541
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,980
Go to simple hangout app.

542
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,830
There's not much to it.

543
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,540
We're going to go down,
and basically

544
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,850
there's some styling.

545
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,510
And there's a button, and
there's a thing that when you

546
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,360
press the button, it tells
you who's in the hangout.

547
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,192
It's not super exciting.

548
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:44,160
Oh shoot, we can't
run this because

549
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,206
you're running a hangout.

550
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,390
JONATHAN: Yes, we can't
run it [INAUDIBLE].

551
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:47,990
WOLFF: Ah, curses.

552
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:53,684
So darn, that ruins my
showing an exception.

553
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,440
JONATHAN: Isn't there
a screen shot?

554
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,200
WOLFF: Well, it's cool.

555
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,650
JONATHAN: OK.

556
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,028
WOLFF: There's a screen shot
in the docs, but people can

557
00:22:59,028 --> 00:22:59,760
look that up.

558
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,610
So anyway, that is presented
as an extension.

559
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,920
However, if you download it
and serve it yourself and

560
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,130
don't check the extension box,
it will show up a main app.

561
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,090
JONATHAN: Yeah, so a good tip.

562
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,130
All the sample apps that
we have hosted

563
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,250
under a gadget XML--

564
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,450
in the past and moving
forward--

565
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,850
you can actually just take that
and pass it into a new

566
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,750
project, a new hangout app.

567
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,940
So you can just run
it and test it.

568
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,770
It's really good if you're
trying to show somebody really

569
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,750
quickly and you don't
have an app made.

570
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,260
And it's also a great way
to test without hosting.

571
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,715
WOLFF: It's also a great way to
test that you are correctly

572
00:23:29,715 --> 00:23:33,660
starting a hangout if you're
having private connection

573
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,590
issues or something like that.

574
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,250
Wait, is my app broken,
or am I just

575
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,570
having connection problems?

576
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,426
So that's a great thing to do.

577
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:45,640
It's also just fun
to play with.

578
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,090
[INAUDIBLE].

579
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,790
OK, we talked about OA.

580
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,120
Can you go into Fact
real quickly?

581
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,980
JONATHAN: Yes.

582
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,210
WOLFF: We talked a little bit
about how do I get an access

583
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,150
to open, and do I have a link
to a hangout experiment that

584
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,586
will allow you to get an open.

585
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,150
That is experimental.

586
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,436
It's experimental for a number
of reasons, including that the

587
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:09,430
JSAPI is still in alpha.

588
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,170
JONATHAN: Yes.

589
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,450
WOLFF: But we do encourage you
to use it and tell us how it's

590
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,185
working for you.

591
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,320
JONATHAN: And I believe some
of the initial apps there

592
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,070
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

593
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,422
Are actually using
that JS client.

594
00:24:19,422 --> 00:24:19,864
So it is working.

595
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:22,520
It works well.

596
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,275
Just since you brought up the
Facts, we just started this

597
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:29,340
new Facts section for issues
that come up in Office Hours

598
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,970
and the forum.

599
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,250
So we might be adding more
and more really relevant

600
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,770
questions to this.

601
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,980
WOLFF: And actually brings us
to one of the new features.

602
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,160
We didn't--

603
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,206
JONATHAN: It's my favorite.

604
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:43,014
Aside from Launch, it's
my favorite feature.

605
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,310
WOLFF: Besides Launch, your
favorite feature.

606
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,670

607
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,170
If you're working with
media overlays.

608
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,214
So you're doing the
face tracking.

609
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:56,200
Can you make yourself a dog?

610
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,580
JONATHAN: Can I do dogs?

611
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,140
WOLFF: Wait, no.

612
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,750
You would have to
make us a dog.

613
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,580
If you're doing face tracking,
if you're doing overlays, up

614
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,400
until this--

615
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,280
[LAUGHS].

616
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,530
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

617
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,760

618
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,500
[? If you ever wanted to ?]
exhibiting being animals,

619
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,430
which is adorable, up until this
point, you have only been

620
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,776
able to do HTTP requests to get
those off of the server.

621
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:28,390
Now, you can actually
use a data URI.

622
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,950
JONATHAN: Yes.

623
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,880
WOLFF: We have an example of
the data URI, with the

624
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,260
smallest data URI I could find
that would still be coherent.

625
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,560
Follow that link.

626
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,624
It's so exciting.

627
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:40,326
I'm so proud of it.

628
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:43,700
It is a little tiny
green spot.

629
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,050
But anyway, that's an example.

630
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,610
But it can be really useful if
you're drawing something in a

631
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,760
canvas, and you want to rig it
up as an extension, or you're

632
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,010
having somebody recording
audio--

633
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,230

634
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,935
or downloading audio
and playing it--

635
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,580
and then you want to
just pull it off.

636
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,516
JONATHAN: Or if you just want
to reduce image size and not

637
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:03,914
actually have to download
images.

638
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:05,760
WOLFF: Yes.

639
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,440
JONATHAN: Pretty exciting.

640
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,290
WOLFF: Yeah, that's
really cool.

641
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,230
The demo that we did for South
by Southwest, where you draw

642
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,620
on your face and then it appears
on your thing, I

643
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,956
actually did that to a server
where I actually uploaded and

644
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:17,175
downloaded it.

645
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,720
Now, I can get rid of that stuff
and just make it so it

646
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,750
goes directly to your browser
in your feed.

647
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,590
JONATHAN: This opens
up a lot more

648
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,480
possibilities with [? data ?]

649
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,830
overlays.

650
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,830
WOLFF: Yeah, really
excited about what

651
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,833
people can do with overlays.

652
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,700
The other thing that we added,
which also concerns overlays--

653
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,903
and actually, this one is only
for people who have the

654
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:43,540
plug-in version 2.8 and above.

655
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,950
JONATHAN: 2.8.5 actually.

656
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,830
WOLFF: 2.8.5 and above.

657
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,790
Is that you can have multiple
overlays on.

658
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,780
So under the old scheme--

659
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,450
Gerwin's eyes lit up.

660
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,900
Under the old scheme,
you could only

661
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,700
have a single overlay.

662
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,620
Or if you played a sound through
that hangout, then it

663
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,295
would only play one.

664
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:04,200
It would cancel all your
other overlays.

665
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,440
Now, we support multiple
overlays.

666
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,090
I believe 2.8.5 is out
for Windows and Mac.

667
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,670
JONATHAN: That's correct.

668
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,950
Most Chrome users should
have that already.

669
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,800
It's also [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
off their Firefox.

670
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,260
WOLFF: Yeah, so way cool.

671
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:27,235
And in fact, our new Fx apps
extension that's going to be

672
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:30,880
in the app actually does have as
many overlays as you want.

673
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,915
JONATHAN: And the Fx app, it's
the cat dog overlay to the

674
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:37,701
next level, plus plus.

675
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,192
WOLFF: Yeah, plus [INAUDIBLE].

676
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:43,540

677
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,245
JONATHAN: So for users, if you
require the multiple overlays,

678
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:49,686
they'll be prompted
to upgrade, and it

679
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:51,700
should be going out.

680
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,860
[INAUDIBLE] there's
a way to check.

681
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,580
If your users complain about not
having it, they can got to

682
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
[INAUDIBLE].

683
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,178
WOLFF: And figure out whether
they've got the

684
00:27:59,178 --> 00:27:59,822
right one or not.

685
00:27:59,822 --> 00:28:01,072
JONATHAN: And [? debug. ?]

686
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,270

687
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,690
What else did we want
to cover today?

688
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,685

689
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:12,080
WOLFF: Actually, that's
all the new

690
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,445
features, which was a lot.

691
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:17,180
JONATHAN: It was like
a whirlwind.

692
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,280
WOLFF: A whirlwind tour.

693
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,154
We work right next
to each other.

694
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:23,370

695
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,080
JONATHAN: So I think first, I
want to start with Gerwin and

696
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,730
Siegfried if they have
any questions.

697
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,920
I know Gerwin already asked one,
but please let us know.

698
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,742
GERWIN: Actually, all my
questions have been answered.

699
00:28:32,742 --> 00:28:34,525
Now, I'm going to have to play
with the new things, and there

700
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:36,900
will be more questions maybe.

701
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,020
JONATHAN: Awesome.

702
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,000
So we're expecting
a Hangout Disco?

703
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,700
WOLFF: Hangout Disco.

704
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,160
GERWIN: Yes.

705
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,310
JONATHAN: Awesome.

706
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,300
SIEGFRIED: I'm working on
the homepage already.

707
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,540
WOLFF: I hope you're
using new button.

708
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,650
JONATHAN: So Gerwin, I
haven't you seen you

709
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,190
go in Hangout Disco.

710
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,380
WOLFF: Well, now they'll
have the opportunity.

711
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,200
You can [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

712
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,940
JONATHAN: It's exactly
what it sounds like.

713
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,640
WOLFF: It is a disco
in a hangout.

714
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,940
SIEGFRIED: In 3-D.

715
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,540
WOLFF: I also strongly
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

716
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:01,950
JONATHAN: Yes, Web GL.

717
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,280
Siegfried, any questions
from you?

718
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,050
SIEGFRIED: Yeah, I'm
waiting for updates

719
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,885
for the regular API.

720
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:17,560
I haven't tried hangouts yet,
but I will do it now, I think.

721
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,480
And yeah, I'm still playing with
the regular API, doing

722
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,100
some stuff with it.

723
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,330
And I'm waiting for [? access ?]
for more streams

724
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:35,720
and more not so public items
on the regular posts.

725
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,450
JONATHAN: Right, actually, I
saw your post. That's great

726
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,960
feedback, and Marie
communicated that.

727
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,260
And the answer for the general
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

728
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,490
API status is we're still
working on things.

729
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,325
And we don't have any
comment of when they

730
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,150
release, but we're--

731
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,110
WOLFF: Hey guys, we are not
close enough to the

732
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,325
microphones.

733
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:58,050
How are we doing?

734
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,430
Is this better?

735
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,680
JONATHAN: OK.

736
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,010

737
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,195
So we're going to up to the post
and see if there are any

738
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,445
questions that we can answer.

739
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:11,690

740
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,950
WOLFF: Actually, I'm looking
at the post right now, and

741
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,700
pretty much, there's
been a lot of,

742
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,370
yay, which is wonderful.

743
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,730
And complaining that--

744
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,730
you know what it is?

745
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,130
It's your fan being
picked up by the--

746
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,000
JONATHAN: Oh.

747
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,250
WOLFF: It's so noisy.

748
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,514

749
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:36,378
JONATHAN: I'm actually
going to drop out.

750
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:39,810
WOLFF: Yeah, why don't you
close your thing there.

751
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,170

752
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,300
Oh, create topic and
hangout title.

753
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,680
You're still able to set
the hangout title.

754
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:57,500
When you click on the Hangout
button, users get the ability

755
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,410
to set their topic.

756
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,610
Asking for I'd like
to set the topic--

757
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,300
JONATHAN: Programtically?

758
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,860
WOLFF: Programatically,
that's a cool idea.

759
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,670

760
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,650
That's cool.

761
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,950
We should look into that.

762
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,501
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

763
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:16,920
Actually questions have
been pretty much--

764
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,445
JONATHAN: I'm looking through
the original posting.

765
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:22,060

766
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,930
SIEGFRIED: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

767
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,940
Can I just ask another
question?

768
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:33,640
I had always had the problem of
getting the right time of

769
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,266
the hangout because you're
announcing it in your time,

770
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:42,640
and I'm seeing it in my time
because I live in Germany.

771
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,900
So we have a difference of
eight or nine hours.

772
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,450
And it would be very cool if
there is a future in the

773
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,890
posting that you can surround
date and time with some

774
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,490
special characters and
they get converted

775
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,976
to the local time.

776
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,810
JONATHAN: Yeah, We
would be cool.

777
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,764
So that would be more of a
general product feature.

778
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:06,710
SIEGFRIED: Yeah.

779
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,170
WOLFF: Yeah, that's
a good idea.

780
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,350
JONATHAN: Like a macro
script kind of thing?

781
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,290
WOLFF: Or are you talking more
about having the locale

782
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,840
included with the post?

783
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,800
JONATHAN: No, I think the idea,
which is pretty cool, is

784
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,590
something that you would see in
a CNS system where you just

785
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:26,235
put time, and it would convert
it for each client for their

786
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,690
local time.

787
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:34,020
If I did 11:30 PST, it would
go to the German time zone

788
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,444
automatically.

789
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:37,810
It's a cool idea.

790
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,720
We'll definitely send
that back up.

791
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,180
So any more questions
from the stream?

792
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,964
WOLFF: No, I think we're
actually doing pretty well.

793
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,080
We're really excited to see what
kinds of things you guys

794
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,110
are building, and we would
absolutely love it if you sent

795
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,390
us public apps that
we can play with.

796
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,780
JONATHAN: Yeah, especially
on our plus pages.

797
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,050
We're start [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
them.

798
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:03,286
And back just to review, when
you're ready to go live, you

799
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:04,102
publish that app.

800
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:07,430
You can host the link inside
Google+ or any other social

801
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,140
media tool directly.

802
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,040
Of course, you could also use
the button and put it on the

803
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,580
site or anywhere that
hosts the HTML.

804
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,450
WOLFF: Some kind of
loading page.

805
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,120
JONATHAN: And yeah, that's how
you get your app around.

806
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,710
And one somebody uses your app,
they don't necessarily

807
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,770
have to go searching back for
that app again because we

808
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,720
service that in the Recently
Used tab inside the app.

809
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,800
WOLFF: Yeah, Recently Used.

810
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,490
Extensions do not appear
in Recently Used.

811
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,410
Extensions are, again,
designed to be more

812
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,830
personalized apps, so
do be aware of that.

813
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,120
JONATHAN: Of course, we have
our feedback channels.

814
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,720
So we have our Issue Tracker for
general Google= stuff, and

815
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,480
that's the best place to surface
issues with that

816
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,600
hangouts API or the
apps in general.

817
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,750
We have our forums
or questions and

818
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,025
answers type of posting.

819
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:59,700
And of course, you can follow
us at Google+ and ask us

820
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,420
questions directly there.

821
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,720
And I think we're waiting now
for you guys to make some

822
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,880
awesome apps.

823
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,139
SIEGFRIED: Concerning the
hangout button, is it possible

824
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,050
to share someone else's
hangout buttons?

825
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,610
For example, if Gerwin was
publishing his hangout and the

826
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,400
button, can I use that hangout
button on my site also.

827
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,639
JONATHAN: Yes, once an app is
published publicly, then it's

828
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,830
just a URL with--

829
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,790
WOLFF: It's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

830
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,060
question mark, VID equals the
name of your product.

831
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,350
SIEGFRIED: OK.

832
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,150
JONATHAN: So anybody can
show that around.

833
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,389
So you can email that.

834
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,420
WOLFF: You can post
a gallery of apps,

835
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,520
whatever you want to do.

836
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,679
We'd love to see stuff
like that.

837
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,100
SIEGFRIED: Cool.

838
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,250
JONATHAN: So we want to create
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] on it, right?

839
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,030
And you can also generate
those links

840
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,690
dynamically, right?

841
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,122
Because if you have a series
of GIDs, you can

842
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:57,285
just spit them out.

843
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:57,750
WOLFF: Yes.

844
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,455
But yest, please, feel free
to use our graphics.

845
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:00,930
JONATHAN: Great.

846
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,990
Well, I want to thank
Gerwin and Siegfried

847
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,290
for joining us today.

848
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:10,040
Thanks for all the questions
and hanging out with us.

849
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,050
Till next time, I guess.

850
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,844
WOLFF: Yeah, we'll see
you next week.

851
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,290
JONATHAN: Thanks, guys.

852
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,680
WOLFF: Thanks all.

853
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,930
SIEGFRIED: Bye.

854
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,230
