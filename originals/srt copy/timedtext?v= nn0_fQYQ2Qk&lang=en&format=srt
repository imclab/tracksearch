1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,986

2
00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:04,860
JAN KLEINERT: Hey, welcome to
another episode of Apps Script

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,650
Office Hours.

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,190
I'm Jan Kleinert.

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,940
We have a new team member
here with us today.

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,700
This is Arun.

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,870
So he's joining us for
the first time.

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,820
And he's also a member of the
Apps Script Developer

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,920
Relations Team.

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,300
So let's go ahead
and get started.

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,550
First, before we jump into the
questions that we have in the

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,670
Moderator page, I wanted to
show you something in the

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,290
Chrome Web Store that
we added this week.

14
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,010
So I'm going to turn on
screen sharing here.

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:42,920
And show you this window.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,520
So we posted a Google Apps
Script app, which basically

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,440
will take you to
script.google.com, which is

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,950
the standalone script editor
in the Chrome Web Store

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,120
actually just yesterday,
I guess it was.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,130
So if you use Chrome and you
also use Apps Script a lot,

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,890
this would be a handy web
app for you to install.

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,090
What it will do is, you'll get
an icon for Apps Script on

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,080
your new tab page.

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,116
It'll make it easy for you
to find it and launch it.

25
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:11,260
So check it out.

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,755
And again, it simply will take
you to script.google.com to

27
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,880
the standalone script editor.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,770
So let me jump over to Google
Moderator here.

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,850
So we have four or
five questions.

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,280
And we'll just work
through them here.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,000
And then once we're done with
that, I'll jump back to the

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,370
Hangout, and we can take any
live questions that we have.

33
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,450
So the first one here, let me
refresh to make sure that we

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,020
have the most up to date.

35
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,180
OK.

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,930
So "is there a time frame for
adding the rest of the UI app

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,595
widgets to the GUI builder?

38
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:47,430
Thanks for addressing my
question on September 6.

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,820
Sorry I missed the live Hangout
by a few minutes."

40
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,640
Said I'd look into it and
provide feedback.

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,180
So that's right.

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
I did.

43
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,070
And I don't have concrete
feedback yet.

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,560
One question I got in response
was, which specific widgets

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,270
would be most useful to you?

46
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,000
Are there certain ones, like a
small subset of ones that you

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,470
are looking for specifically
to be in GUI builder?

48
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,430
Or do you really just want
everything that's available in

49
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,780
UI app to be there in
the GUI builder?

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,050
Knowing specific ones that would
be the most valuable

51
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,290
will help us prioritize.

52
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,110
But again, I don't have any
concrete information on

53
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,360
when/if we'll be adding all the
UI apps to the GUI builder

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,970
at this time.

55
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,830
But I will continue to check
on that, and I'll

56
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,446
update if we have more.

57
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:34,230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Are you sharing
the screen still?

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,640
JAN KLEINERT: I am, yes.

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,800
So yes, hopefully everybody
can see this.

60
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,290
And the link to the Moderator
questions is also available

61
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,920
from the Google Developers--

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,500
sorry,
developers.google.com/live

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,370
from the entry there.

64
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,830
It should be embedded
in the page.

65
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,340
Second question is
on triggers.

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,790
So "I keep running into
situations where I wish I

67
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,110
could immediately trigger a
script, maybe by SMS or on

68
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,910
receipt of an email.

69
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,175
One minute triggers won't
work for this use case.

70
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:04,440
Is there a workaround, or does
Google plan on providing a

71
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,550
live event trigger or even
a post trigger?"

72
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,960
So this is a really
good question.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,820
For those of you who aren't
familiar with triggers,

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,620
triggers are basically a way
to execute an Apps Script

75
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,560
function after some sort
of event happens.

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,430
So it could be a time-based
trigger, where you have this

77
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,780
trigger run every
five minutes.

78
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,730
So that would be a clock-based
event.

79
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,870
Or in the case of Google
Spreadsheets, we do have some

80
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,300
of these event-based triggers.

81
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,560
So when a Google Spreadsheets
form is submitted or when a

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,320
spreadsheet is opened or when
a spreadsheet is edited, it

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,620
can fire off an event as well.

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,400
Outside of Google Spreadsheets,
we don't

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,700
currently have product-based
event triggers.

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,120
But it sounds like
that is something

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,390
that this poster wants.

88
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,070
So what would be really helpful
here is in the issue

89
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,800
tracker to raise a feature
request for us with the

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,440
specific types of event
triggers that

91
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,080
you're looking for.

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,890
What are the ones that would
help you be able to do the use

93
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,060
cases that you can't
currently do today?

94
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,630
We are looking into the
possibility of adding

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,890
additional event triggers.

96
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,790
But I don't have specifics on
which ones, when, that sort of

97
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,380
thing right now.

98
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,040
But it's always helpful for us
to know what it is that you

99
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,670
want the most.

100
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,782
So do let us now in the issue
tracker for that.

101
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:33,950
OK, the third one here--
"display of data in a UI." And

102
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm assuming--

103
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,560
it looks like this is a question
related to UI App.

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,730
So it's not a problem for data
with multiple records at once.

105
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,900
So you can use a grid or
FlexTable for that.

106
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,250
But "how to display data where
you only want to see one

107
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,620
record at a time with buttons
for next, back, first, last to

108
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,250
click through the records?"

109
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,690
Well, off the top of my head, I
don't think we have a built

110
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,300
in UI app widget that will
do this for you.

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,810
I can visualize in my head what
you're talking about.

112
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,060
It's the kind of--

113
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,720

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,860
almost like a record in a
database viewer kind of thing.

115
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,370
I don't think there's
a built-in one

116
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,580
supported by UI App.

117
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,670
So I think if you wanted
something like this, you would

118
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,730
probably have to build
it yourself.

119
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,310
So you could have a panel
in the center that

120
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,830
would pull in the--

121
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,320
a panel with labels, maybe, that
would pull in the data

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,860
that you want to display for
each individual record.

123
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,990
And then you could
hook up buttons.

124
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,340
So you could hook up a button
for next that calls a

125
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,390
function, that loads the next
record and refreshes the panel

126
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,910
and the data.

127
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,770
And the same thing for back
and first and last.

128
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,500
So we don't have something out
of the box, I don't think,

129
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,390
that will do this for you.

130
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,820
But you could build something
that would do that.

131
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,370
Let's see.

132
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,050
And I'm just going to jump over
and make sure we're not

133
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,250
getting any follow-ups
in the chat window.

134
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,730
Looks like we're not.

135
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,820
So "for a spreadsheet cell, what
is the best way to test

136
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,270
if the value is a hyperlink?" So
I went ahead and put a link

137
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,050
in the response here.

138
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,620
If I'm understanding the
question correctly, you have a

139
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,320
spreadsheet where some of the
cell values may be hyperlinks.

140
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,880
And you want to be able to
determine which ones and then

141
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,710
do something based on that.

142
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,680
So from your script, you
could pull in the

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,420
values of the cells.

144
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,810
And then what I think would
probably be the simplest would

145
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,460
be to basically run a regular
expression, run a matcher

146
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,220
against that, and determine if
the value in that cell matches

147
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,310
a URL format.

148
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,700
It's actually kind of tricky
to build a good regular

149
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,620
expression for validating
URLs.

150
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,710
But here's an article I just ran
across that had some tips

151
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,690
for, depending on how complete
and how fancy you want to get,

152
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,940
some different ways
to build URL

153
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,590
regular expression matchers.

154
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,790
So hopefully that's helpful.

155
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,040
And then this last question
here. "Is there an easy to

156
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,180
access the Google Drive API,
not the Doc list default

157
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,690
services from App Script?" OK,
so "URL fetch OAuth config

158
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:12,530
doesn't work because Drive API
requires OAuth2." And I think

159
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,860
we may have Yan on the
live Hangout here.

160
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,050
So related to that, is this
the Drive SDK that you're

161
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,010
looking for?

162
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,260
So this is the API for actually
integrating a web app

163
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,710
with Google Drive.

164
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,710
If you can hear me and you're
there, you can type into the

165
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,850
chat window if you--

166
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,340
here we go.

167
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,700
We've got some typing
going on.

168
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,770
So more or less, yes.

169
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,290
So if it requires OAuth2, too
and I think you're correct

170
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,800
that our current OAuth support
is not supporting OAuth2 yet,

171
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,060
that may not be possible
at this time.

172
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,430
I will go back and check with
the team to see if there's a

173
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,210
workaround for that.

174
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,830
But I think that if they only
support OAuth2, it may not be

175
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,620
possible yet.

176
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,480
So I will verify that
and let you know.

177
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,700
I'll update this Moderator entry
so that you can have a

178
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,520
solid answer.

179
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,050
We do know that there are lots
of use cases out there where

180
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,290
we need OAuth2 support.

181
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,790
So that something that's on
our road map that we're

182
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,490
working towards.

183
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,476
But we don't have the OAuth2
support in Apps Script yet.

184
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:29,040

185
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,730
Any other questions from
our live Hangout

186
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,980
participants today?

187
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,386

188
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:37,760
Turn off screensharing
for now.

189
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,840

190
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,090
No questions?

191
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,870

192
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,410
OK.

193
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,010
Well, our usual--
oh, here we go.

194
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,040
We have--

195
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,870
so Yan is talking about
the API from

196
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,380
developers.google.com/drive.

197
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,890
Let me just click over and take
a quick look at that.

198
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,390

199
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,850
Yeah, so that is right.

200
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,720
That is the Drive SDK.

201
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,120
And I don't believe it's
possible to interact with that

202
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,630
from Apps Script today.

203
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,210
We have been getting
requests for it.

204
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,830
So I'll follow up with the
team and find out what's

205
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,210
required basically on our side
to make that possible from

206
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,150
within Apps Script.

207
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,366
And I'll update on the
issue tracker.

208
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:33,250
But yeah, hopefully, that's at
least helpful to know you're

209
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,320
not doing it wrong.

210
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,750
It's just not supported yet.

211
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,120

212
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,520
So I was going to mention Eric
and Ikai, who are often here

213
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,350
for Office Hours, are in Austin,
Texas today because

214
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,310
we're having an Apps Script
hackathon there.

215
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,030
So I'm hoping that next week,
we'll have some exciting apps

216
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,450
and scripts to tell you about
that were built at the

217
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,460
hackathon, once we hear
how all of that went.

218
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,980

219
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,820
So here's a question from one
of our Hangout attendees.

220
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,030
So "can the content service do
OAuth authentication?" So I

221
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,370
was speaking with somebody else
about this last week.

222
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,300
So do you mean kind of like
inbound OAuth so that

223
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,290
basically you can use this as
a web service, basically?

224
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,510

225
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,876
And for those of you who
aren't familiar with--

226
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,980
yeah, who aren't familiar with
content service, it allows you

227
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,350
to serve up text formatted--

228
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,690
so instead of using UI App
or HTML service to serve

229
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,430
web-based content, it can
serve up like RSS, JSON,

230
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,350
things like that.

231
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,410
And so no, today it's not
possible to support OAuth.

232
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:59,320
So, for example, if you wanted
to have it accessing data of

233
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,030
some-- maybe Twitter's API or
something like that, we don't

234
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,100
support that OAuth flow for
content service yet today.

235
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,990
But we know there's
a need for it.

236
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,070
Our engineering team is aware.

237
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,970
And they're looking into
possibilities for the easiest

238
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,660
way to support that.

239
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,510
So I believe there is
a feature request in

240
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,510
the tracker for that.

241
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,160
If there's not, go ahead
and add one in.

242
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,580
And I'll hook it up
with our kind of

243
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,120
internal tracking process.

244
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,862
So that we can keep you aware
of the progress on that.

245
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,210
OK.

246
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,955
And any other questions?

247
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:39,390

248
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,700
I am looking forward to when
we have that available for

249
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,450
content service.

250
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,570
Because there's a lot of really
cool things that you

251
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,240
can do once we have
support for that.

252
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,790

253
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,560
OK.

254
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,520
Let me go just check back
on the Moderator

255
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,985
page one more time.

256
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,861
See if anything new came in.

257
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,690

258
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,940
Nope.

259
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,560

260
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,740
Well, in that case, we
may have a very short

261
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,700
Office Hours today.

262
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,510
I won't--

263
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,320
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I could
throw a question in, Jan.

264
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,462
JAN KLEINERT: OK, sure.

265
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:18,446
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

266
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:18,940
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah, go ahead.

267
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,280
MALE SPEAKER: So I published
a [AUDIO LOST].

268
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,910
One of the things that I've
noticed is once I installed it

269
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,900
in the Chrome Web Store,
is the icon that

270
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,705
came is the Apps icon.

271
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:35,060

272
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,880
Is there a [AUDIO LOST]

273
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,760
that published to the
Chrome Web Store can

274
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,240
customize that icon?

275
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,430
JAN KLEINERT: Yes.

276
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,820
So that is something that we're
currently working on.

277
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,750
The support for that is
pretty limited today.

278
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,550
There is a complex way that
I can follow up with.

279
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,090

280
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,920
It's complicated.

281
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,830
There's a complicated way you
can kind of get the manifesto.

282
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,750
So what we're trying to do with
the Chrome Web Store is

283
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,870
make it simple for you so that
you don't have to build the

284
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,290
manifest file and the zip
package that you have to

285
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,990
upload to the Chrome
Web Store.

286
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,750
However, we didn't at launch
support a way to customize the

287
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,630
icon that gets installed
on the new tab page.

288
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,300
And that's I think the
issue that you had.

289
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,820
Because yes, it's obviously
a better--

290
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,580
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.

291
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,250
JAN KLEINERT: --experience if
you can have the proper

292
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,010
branding for your app with
your own icon there.

293
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,350
So that is something we are
definitely planning to add.

294
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,040
But in the meantime, I can
explain a workaround, a way

295
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,590
for you to kind of get that
manifest file and the assets

296
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,870
that you need to then repackage
the zip file and

297
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,050
upload to your Chrome
Web Store listing in

298
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,420
the developer dashboard.

299
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,060
So I'm trying to think where
is the best place for me to

300
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,790
put this information.

301
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,550
Maybe what I'll do is I'll
post something to the

302
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,890
Moderator page later
with instructions

303
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,165
on how to do that.

304
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:54,900
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

305
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,226
JAN KLEINERT: OK?

306
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:56,670
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

307
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,280
Or do you want me to--

308
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,690
or would you rather a Stack
Overflow question?

309
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,660
JAN KLEINERT: Either
way is fine.

310
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,590
I'm going to just put it on the
Moderator page since it's

311
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,330
within the context of this
Office Hours today.

312
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,906
And it's messy.

313
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:17,405
So until we have the proper
support built in, I'll just

314
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:18,010
explain it here.

315
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,540
And it will hopefully give
you what you need,

316
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,318
but not be too complex.

317
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,300
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

318
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,197
And I guess one of the other
questions that I've noticed

319
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,590
[AUDIO LOST]

320
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,520
and getting some really
interesting things

321
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,320
happening with that.

322
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,370
I saw in the issue tracker,
I just wondered is there--

323
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,880

324
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,710
is it [AUDIO LOST]

325
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,640
or is it just sort of thing--

326
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,620
what I did, for example, I wrote
just a simple little

327
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,850
script account of all
the [AUDIO LOST]

328
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,690
in there.

329
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,250
And sometimes it would come back
with four and come back

330
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,860
with 55 where I knew there were
55 objects in the store.

331
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,150
And I thought refreshing my
browser, doing that sort of

332
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,670
thing, didn't seem to fix it.

333
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,070
But I would log out,
come back later.

334
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,540
And it would [AUDIO LOST]

335
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,670
times.

336
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,060
My impression was, because the
object sort of came back, that

337
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,640
it was the integrity or some
sort of connection issue.

338
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,181
Do you have any--

339
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,600
JAN KLEINERT: Any
updates on it?

340
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,240
So yes.

341
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,966
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
any updates or--

342
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:33,840
JAN KLEINERT: Yeah.

343
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
And the audio was kind
of going in and out.

344
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,460
I think I got the gist of
what you were saying.

345
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,770
I'm going to kind of repeat
it back to make sure.

346
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,290
So there is a script DB issue
happening right now.

347
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,620
It doesn't seem to be happening
in all cases.

348
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,810
But what you're experiencing,
where you know there's X

349
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,180
number of items in the database,
but when you do a

350
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,560
query, you're getting Y back.

351
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,230
And even that may not be
consistent from, for example,

352
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,290
if you access the web app from
the dev URL versus the

353
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,540
published version URL.

354
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,140

355
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,130
The engineers are working
hard to figure this

356
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,380
one out right now.

357
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,560

358
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,100
It seems to be--

359
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,760
I don't want to speculate too
much, but it's not that the

360
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,650
data is not there.

361
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,350
You're just getting inconsistent
views of the data

362
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,960
in certain cases.

363
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,570
And we're working
really hard to--

364
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,980
MALE SPEAKER: That's
my impression.

365
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,650
JAN KLEINERT: Yes.

366
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,740
Because it's obviously not how
it's supposed to be working.

367
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,110
So that is a serious
bug that they're

368
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,560
looking into right now.

369
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,080
And we hope to have a solution
for that soon.

370
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,030
As soon as we do, I'll update
the issue tracker

371
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,120
and let you all know.

372
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,100
But we can definitely reproduce
it, and the

373
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,200
engineers are on it.

374
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,740
I was talking to them about
it this morning.

375
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,285
So they're trying to fix
it as soon as possible.

376
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:58,510

377
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,340
Any other questions?

378
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,300
Comments?

379
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,550
Things you want to talk about?

380
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,390

381
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,140
OK.

382
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,460
Well, in that case, thank
you all for attending.

383
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,069
And I think we'll just go
ahead and wrap up early.

384
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,839
And we'll see you hopefully
next week.

385
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:18,880
All right.

386
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,209
Thank you, everybody.

387
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,459
Bye.

388
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,567
