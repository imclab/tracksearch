00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,860

00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:30,200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,850
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

4
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,690
I'm Paul Kinlan.

5
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,590
And I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,420
And today we're doing the GDL
Presents, Google Developers

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,890
Live Presents, about the Chrome
Web Lab experiment.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,860
I think it's the first of our
current set of Hangouts that

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,630
we're going to run.

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,730
And with me I've got
Roger and Matias?

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,780
MATIAS: Yep, that's correct.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,500
PAUL KINLAN: Matias,
brilliant.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,210
I got them with me.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,290
And they worked on
the project.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,890
So if you want to give
yourselves a little bit of an

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,300
introduction, and--

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,840
ROGER: Yeah, I'm Roger.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,190
I'm a creative technologist
at [INAUDIBLE].

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,810
And I've been the technical
leader of the project.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,770
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,420
MATIAS: Yeah, I'm Matias.

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,815
And I'm a creative technologist
as well, and also

23
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,480
at [INAUDIBLE].

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,710
And I mainly focused on the
Orchestra in the Web Lab.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,670
PAUL KINLAN: Oh cool, so what's
your day-to-day like at

26
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,340
the moment, your kind
of average day?

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,100
ROGER: I was managing other
developers and doing some

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,200
programming as well, as well
as setting a little bit the

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,360
rules in terms of programming.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,350
PAUL KINLAN: The technical
direction and everything.

31
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,560
ROGER: Yeah, a little bit.

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,220
And handling a lot the client
requests as well, making sure

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,210
that you guys were happy
with everything.

34
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,070
PAUL KINLAN: Sweet,
I'm always happy.

35
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,750
So thanks.

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,050
[LAUGHTER]

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,330
ROGER: And that's it actually.

38
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,685
MATIAS: And I was more into
the code, writing both the

39
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,080
front end and the back end.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,570
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, sweet.

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,660
MATIAS: For the Orchestra
and interfacing with the

42
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,130
instruments.

43
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,830
PAUL KINLAN: Sweet, so we'll
just do a little bit of a

44
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,470
brief introduction about
Web Lab itself.

45
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,850
So Web Lab is a series of five
real world Chrome experiments

46
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,140
that live on the web and also in
the British Science Museum.

47
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,750
And I don't know how long
it's been-- it's been in

48
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,715
development for quite a long
time now, hasn't it?

49
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,860
But essentially you can go to
the British Science Museum

50
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,300
today and start experimenting
with the experiments in the

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,260
real world.

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,220
And today we're going to
talk mainly about the--

53
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,880
I'd say the virtual world, but
the online web experience.

54
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,780
So you could be--

55
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,780
the way I always liked to pitch
this was you could be

56
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,510
actually in the museum
interacting with the

57
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,200
experiment through the browser
right there, walk 10 feet

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,020
away, still be interacting with
it, walk into the next

59
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,680
room, and still interact with
it in the same way that you

60
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,890
would if you were
at the museum.

61
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,360
And then you go all the way over
to Google I/O last year.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,180
And then you're 7,000 miles
away in San Francisco.

63
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,460
And you're still interacting
with the experiments in the

64
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,570
same type of way.

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,550
I think that's a fair
assumption.

66
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,120
MATIAS: Yeah.

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,450
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it's
a fair summary.

68
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,670
So we're going to go through the
actual experiments today.

69
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,550
We're going to go through
one which is

70
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,290
called the Lab Tag Explorer.

71
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,390
And the lab tag itself is kind
of-- it's the core component

72
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,550
of Web Lab, isn't it really?

73
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,520
So if you want to give a little
bit of background on

74
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,825
what Web Lab-- or not Web Lab,
but the lab tag means to you.

75
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:12,310
ROGER: Yeah, so in Web Lab we
wanted to represent people,

76
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,090
people that is interacting
with it at all time.

77
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,150
And a lab tag is your
identification in Web Lab.

78
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,690
So it's something kind of like
an avatar where you can store

79
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,050
all the content that you're
generating in Web Lab.

80
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,030
PAUL KINLAN: Cool, and if you
look at the screen right now,

81
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,220
we have these two streams.

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,180
Are these real-time streams
or are these random?

83
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,960
ROGER: Yeah, they are
generated by code.

84
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,840
And one stream represents
the online people.

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,170
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

86
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,200
ROGER: And the other one the
people that is interacting in

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,780
the museum.

88
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,920
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, and these
are all lab tags that are

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,170
streaming across?

90
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,040

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,390
ROGER: It's not real data
in this stream.

92
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,330
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, OK.

93
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,987
ROGER: Once we go into the Lab
Tag Explorer is where we get

94
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:02,730
the real data.

95
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,002
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, should
we have a quick look in?

96
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,410
We'll zoom in.

97
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,180
That's pretty nice.

98
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,330
And how was that built?

99
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,030
Is this WebGL?

100
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,570
ROGER: Yeah, it is WebGL.

101
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,400
It is in three.js.

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,110
PAUL KINLAN: And now this is
my lab tag that's getting

103
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,760
built right now.

104
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,540
Can you explain a little bit
what these three symbols mean?

105
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,220
ROGER: Yeah, so each of the lab
tags is generated by one

106
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,190
main shape and two
more shapes.

107
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,460
And there's a variation on
rotation between the shape's

108
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,440
color and size.

109
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,340
And under these barrier
[? rows, ?]

110
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,665
we can acquire millions of
different combinations.

111
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:39,930
PAUL KINLAN: Millions?

112
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,100
ROGER: Yeah.

113
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,390
PAUL KINLAN: Wow, that's cool.

114
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,850
ROGER: So it does a lot.

115
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,020
But it's unique for it too.

116
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,980
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, and you also
get the lab tags online.

117
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,720
But you can get it in the
real world as well.

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,800
ROGER: Yeah, the similar thing
in the museum is that you get

119
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,010
a badge, which you have
your lab tag [? in. ?]

120
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,430
And you can put it into each of
the experiments and collect

121
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,210
all your data.

122
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,720
PAUL KINLAN: Right.

123
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,910
ROGER: And once you go back
home, then you can use your

124
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,825
webcam to scan this badge and
receive all the contents that

125
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,830
you have generated.

126
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,830
PAUL KINLAN: I just want to
cover how do you interact with

127
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,420
the webcam?

128
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,030
Is that Flash or is
it getUserMedia?

129
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,620
ROGER: Yeah, that specific
bit of code was Flash.

130
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,200
PAUL KINLAN: Was Flash.

131
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
Is it Flash still?

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,670
ROGER: It was this morning.

133
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,030
PAUL KINLAN: OK, cool.

134
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,250
ROGER: There are other things
in Web Lab that have been

135
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,360
using [INAUDIBLE].

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,930
That's the specific one.

137
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,680
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I think
this has been a really

138
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,840
interesting experiment, really
where we've been trying to

139
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,030
push the boundaries
of what's been

140
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,900
possible inside the browser.

141
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,950
And there are some limits
that we've come up to.

142
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,650
And I think in a later Hangout
that we're going to run where

143
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,370
we talk about the Sketchbots,
we use getUserMedia.

144
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,580
I think, to actually take a
picture of the person from the

145
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,660
webcam using JavaScript.

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,950
Where in this case, we probably
used Flash, right?

147
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,450
ROGER: Yeah.

148
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,610
PAUL KINLAN: I think
this is basically--

149
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,970
there are some things right on
the web that we can't just do

150
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,110
purely nakedly inside the
browser right now.

151
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,250
And we have to do a fallback.

152
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,750
But the theme, it's a
relatively seamless

153
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,626
experience, right?

154
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:09,010
MATIAS: Yeah, and as you
mentioned before, it's been in

155
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,540
production for a long time.

156
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,310
So when we started with it, we
couldn't use getUserMedia.

157
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,080
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I actually
remember talking to you guys

158
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,540
and saying, you know,
getUserMedia is going to be in

159
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,430
the browser in two
months' time.

160
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,710
And then in two months' time,
yeah, it's going to be in the

161
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,310
browser again in two
months' time.

162
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,315
So the really cool thing at
least about Chrome and I

163
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:29,650
believe Firefox as well
now and Opera, we have

164
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,490
getUserMedia, which allows
us to get the user media.

165
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,390
[LAUGHTER]

166
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,665
PAUL KINLAN: That's really
bad, isn't it?

167
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:38,860
And they allow us to basically
get access to the webcam data

168
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,610
just by JavaScript.

169
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,730
We're not going to
see that today.

170
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,250
We're going to go straight into
the Lab Tag Explorer.

171
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,570
You know, I actually really like
this whole fun screen.

172
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,240
It's [? beautiful. ?]

173
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,610
Sorry, I'm just going completely
off track.

174
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,050
That's fine.

175
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,320
Cool, so the Lab Tag Explorer,
let's jump

176
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,040
into the Lab Tag Explorer.

177
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,870
So we were saying before-- oh,
this is beautiful, very nice

178
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,730
loading screens.

179
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,340
So what's happening in the
background at the moment?

180
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,050
Is this--

181
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,490
ROGER: So this just loading
all the specific bits for

182
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,340
these experiments.

183
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,170
PAUL KINLAN: So do you kind of
cache everything locally in

184
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,180
the user's machine?

185
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,010
ROGER: Ah, no.

186
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,990
PAUL KINLAN: Or is it just
basically saying, we're

187
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,730
loading everything.

188
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,987
When it's unload or
[? DOM ?] content

189
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:18,526
ready, essentially we--

190
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,774
ROGER: Yeah, this has
everything, yeah.

191
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,700
PAUL KINLAN: That actually
looks really nice.

192
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,270
You'd normally see
a big white page.

193
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,500
So that's kind of interesting.

194
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,160
That's one of the things I've
been trying to work with

195
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,990
developers on is provide these
relatively seamless

196
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,640
experiences.

197
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,980
Don't let the user see that
things are loading

198
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,320
incrementally in
the background.

199
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,720
Sometimes with documents
it's fine.

200
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,380
But I think for applications
and those types of

201
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,670
experiences, it breaks
away from it.

202
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,130
So should we just describe
what's happening on the

203
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,840
screen right now?

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,730
ROGER: Yeah, so these
experiments is all about

205
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,390
exploring the content that all
the users have been using.

206
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,820
So as I mentioned, each of these
little things is a lab

207
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,770
tag, which represents a user.

208
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,030
PAUL KINLAN: Ah, I see, cool.

209
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,530
ROGER: In this view, we can
see the people who are

210
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,430
actually interacting with
Web Lab in this

211
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,580
precise moment of time.

212
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,230
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

213
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,980
ROGER: You can see that there's
two streams, one for

214
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,780
the museum people and another
one for the people who are

215
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,010
interacting online.

216
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,780
PAUL KINLAN: So the really cool
thing, and I'd encourage

217
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,300
anyone who can get to the
British Science Museum in

218
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,390
London, is that when you go into
the museum, you see these

219
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,420
lab tags falling from the
ceiling right down to the

220
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,130
floor, don't you?

221
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,480
It's really nice.

222
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,800
ROGER: You have the same
experience that we've been

223
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,420
seeing in the online.

224
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,150
There it's represented
in a very big screen.

225
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,059
PAUL KINLAN: So I saw some kind
of lines come up before

226
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,010
when I clicked on someone
from the US.

227
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,330
ROGER: Yeah.

228
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:35,879
PAUL KINLAN: There we go.

229
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,470
ROGER: They're showing some
connections between them.

230
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:38,710
PAUL KINLAN: Nice.

231
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,409
ROGER: Some people probably
they are having lunch.

232
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,080
Or people who are interacting
with Orchestra, some different

233
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,540
data, data visualization
of the users.

234
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,160
PAUL KINLAN: That's
really cool.

235
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,135
And these are actually
live users now?

236
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:53,410
ROGER: Yeah.

237
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,900
PAUL KINLAN: People who are
going or recently interacted

238
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,830
with a Sketchbot.

239
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,260
ROGER: Yeah.

240
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,670
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
cool, isn't it?

241
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,600
MATIAS: And also, these items
flying by, it's--

242
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,200
we choose half an hour
ago all that has

243
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,070
interacted since that part.

244
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,250
So it's constantly updating.

245
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,970
And you can sit for hours
and just look

246
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,990
what people are doing.

247
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,780
PAUL KINLAN: This is really
cool, isn't it?

248
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,210
So just to talk about some of
the technology about this,

249
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,490
this is based on the user's
rough location.

250
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,570
Is this using App Engine's
request notification or the

251
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,620
requests country location
information?

252
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,290
Or is there some
other type of--

253
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,670
ROGER: No, well, [INAUDIBLE].

254
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,245

255
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:41,180
But I think they finally used
some kind of custom built

256
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,130
system to get the information.

257
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,310
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so it just
basically finds the country

258
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,650
and then maps it on.

259
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,920
ROGER: Yeah.

260
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,480
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty nice.

261
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,850
So the client side technology
in this, this is

262
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,930
all WebGL as well?

263
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,270
ROGER: This is WebGL.

264
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,880
This is using three.js,
the same.

265
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,090
And we've been trying to--

266
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,910
for the movement of them,
for the animation--

267
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,230
we've been using steering
behaviors.

268
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,650
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

269
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,780
ROGER: And as you can see,
there's some behaviors for

270
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,300
them to feel a little
bit alive.

271
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,130
But at the same time, they
all follow this path.

272
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,760
PAUL KINLAN: I kind of like how
they've just tried to get

273
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,090
themselves around where
my mouse was.

274
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,720
ROGER: Yeah, we're
in level one.

275
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,820
So this is a nice interesting
bit which in 3D, it's quite

276
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,830
tricky to go from the 2D
world to the 3D world.

277
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,390
For example, the mouse
is in the 2D world.

278
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,900
And then you next interact with
some objects that live in

279
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,840
this 3D world.

280
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,870
But three.js makes
it very easy to.

281
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,080
PAUL KINLAN: OK, so is that
one of the reasons why you

282
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,840
chose three.js in
this project?

283
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,020
ROGER: Yeah, basically without
three.js and with the time

284
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,470
that we've had, it would
have been impossible.

285
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,086
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, does Mr.
[? Dupe ?] know that we--

286
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,660
ROGER: Yeah, we've
been talking.

287
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,761
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, he's
cool, isn't he?

288
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:57,190
That's cool.

289
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,900
That's really interesting.

290
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,380
So these are kind of like
voids essentially?

291
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,350
ROGER: Yeah, they are.

292
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,340
Each of them is like a void.

293
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,500
PAUL KINLAN: And did you notice
any performance issues?

294
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,850
I mean, you're streaming quite
a lot of data across the

295
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,010
screen at the moment.

296
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,515
Were there any performance
issues when you

297
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:12,920
were building this?

298
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,650
ROGER: Yeah, there
was actually.

299
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,750
So these are all sprites,
each of the lab tags.

300
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,660
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

301
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,690
ROGER: But if you use
one texture--

302
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,530
you see that animation?

303
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:23,740
PAUL KINLAN: Mhmm.

304
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,120
ROGER: So how this animation
is done is using a

305
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,010
spreadsheet.

306
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,180
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

307
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,760
ROGER: And if we were using just
one spreadsheet per each

308
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,730
particle, it was impossible
to create this

309
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,210
with so many particles.

310
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,840
So what we ended up using,
it's a system where we

311
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,340
generate textures as
big as they can.

312
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,860
Taking in browsers, I think it's
a canvas of 2,048 pixels.

313
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,660
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

314
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,290
ROGER: And then we fit in as
many lab tags as we can, as

315
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,890
many lab tag sprites per
each of the lab tags.

316
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,280
And then we have some kind of
easy system with some indexes

317
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,210
to access them.

318
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,640
So we're using one or two
very big textures.

319
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,550
And we use UV mapping and
UV offset to access

320
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,612
each of the lab tags.

321
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:20,910
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

322
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,850
So I've actually just clicked
on one of the lab tags.

323
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,550
And we've got this little screen
up here, which is the

324
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,530
lab report.

325
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,570
Can you explain a little bit
about the lab report?

326
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,180
I think you might have
done it at the start.

327
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,300
ROGER: Yeah, so the lab report
is what records all your

328
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,010
interactions.

329
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,660
So you can find all your content
that you've been

330
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,320
generating in Web Lab
in the lab report.

331
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,855
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
cool, isn't it?

332
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:47,350
MATIAS: And some things need
video to render recordings

333
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,540
from the museum, if you draw
yourself in the sand with a

334
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,740
sand robot for our Sketchbots.

335
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,110
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

336
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,680
MATIAS: And the Orchestra
records you and gives you back

337
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,000
a video as well.

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,190
So they may take
time to render.

339
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,130
So you will see a progress here
and can come back at any

340
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,450
point and view your
recordings.

341
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,490
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
cool, isn't it?

342
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,340
That's very nice.

343
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,600
That's one of the things I
really liked about the whole

344
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,630
Web Lab experience.

345
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,750
I took my kids there.

346
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,170
Well, one is only two.

347
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,690
And he couldn't do anything.

348
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,680
But Jack is six going
on seven now.

349
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
And he absolutely
loved the place.

350
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,860
He had his little lab tag.

351
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,400
He checked into every
single thing.

352
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,480
We got back home, put the lab
tag in front of the screen.

353
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,880
And we could share it today.

354
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,090
But I haven't got a lab tag from
my experience when I was

355
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,090
at the museum itself.

356
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,990
But yeah, we got it all back up
on the screen pretty much

357
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,050
straight away.

358
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,766
It was a beautiful experience
really.

359
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

360
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,750
So we have this other section.

361
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,980
Sorry, I just want to jump
in the other location.

362
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,731
Here we go.

363
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:49,981
That's beautiful that.

364
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:52,670

365
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,870
MATIAS: And here we're loading
a lot of data, for many days

366
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,610
back in time.

367
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,350
PAUL KINLAN: Right, OK.

368
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,220
MATIAS: And generating
spreadsheets for this as well.

369
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,940
ROGER: Yeah.

370
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,310
PAUL KINLAN: So this is probably
a silly question.

371
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,070
How is the data stored
in the back end?

372
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,970
Is it all in App Engine?

373
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,300
Or is it in MySQL databases?

374
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,440
ROGER: It's in App Engine.

375
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,640
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, OK, cool.

376
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,140
So you record everything that
happens into App Engine and

377
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,380
then haul it back.

378
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,080
When you bring it back,
is it JSON?

379
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,580
ROGER: Yeah, it really
is JSON.

380
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,610
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

381
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,940
ROGER: And it's amazing
how all the [? VI ?]

382
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,110
JavaScript in [? time ?]

383
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,650
is working.

384
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,650
And it's so fast, so, so fast.

385
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,960
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so how many
data points would you normally

386
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,135
bring back do you
think in that?

387
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:36,090
Because it took about five
seconds to bring everything

388
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,820
back, is it?

389
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,200
ROGER: Yeah, it depends a little
in the graphic and

390
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,500
everything.

391
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,260
But I don't have any numbers
where it's thousands of them.

392
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,320
And in each of them, there's
lots of information.

393
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,880
PAUL KINLAN: So you're
saying it goes back

394
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,590
over a couple of days.

395
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,310
So we can, in theory jump
back over time.

396
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,610
ROGER: Yeah.

397
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,080
PAUL KINLAN: So can you explain
a little bit how you

398
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,690
actually built this little
time sequence thing?

399
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,660
Is it just a series of planes
that you put into a 3D space?

400
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,520
Or is it--

401
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,550
ROGER: Yeah, it's basically,
everything is contained in a

402
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,490
3D container.

403
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,380
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

404
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,790
ROGER: So we don't
move the camera.

405
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,020
We just move this container
up and down.

406
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,530
And it creates this effect
of going back in time.

407
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,550
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so you
just move the camera?

408
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,850
ROGER: No, so the camera--

409
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,530
PAUL KINLAN: It's fixed.

410
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,080
ROGER: It's not moving.

411
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,155
And then we have a 3D container
that just moves.

412
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:26,280
PAUL KINLAN: I got you.

413
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,830
That's pretty cool.

414
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,480
So if I look at it in this
projection, is it everything

415
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,400
prior to this time?

416
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,390
Or is it just at this
point in time?

417
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,350
ROGER: So this is at
this point of time.

418
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,770
And then if you scroll to the
left, it goes back in time.

419
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,800
And you can see that it goes.

420
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,640
PAUL KINLAN: And this is all
data that we've pulled, that's

421
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
been pulled back?

422
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,940
ROGER: Yeah, and when you're
scrolling, we're actually

423
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,970
simplifying it a little
bit because there

424
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,390
were too many points.

425
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:53,630
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

426
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,660
ROGER: And it was becoming--

427
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,940
PAUL KINLAN: So it looked
like coalescent

428
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,620
points in the beginning.

429
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,340
ROGER: Yeah, so there's less
points when you scroll and

430
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,202
then when you release
all of them.

431
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:01,670
PAUL KINLAN: Excellent.

432
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,960
Yeah, that's so cool.

433
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,440
[INAUDIBLE].

434
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,930
Cool.

435
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,720
ROGER: It's very interesting
to see the different flows.

436
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,870
PAUL KINLAN: This is, yeah.

437
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,600
ROGER: Different days
and locations.

438
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,120
PAUL KINLAN: All right.

439
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,270
I'm just going to play with this
for a little bit longer.

440
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,260
Man, that's insane.

441
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,400
That's a lot of interaction,
isn't it?

442
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,230
Cool, so I think we're
close to the end.

443
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,540
I mean, is there anything else
you want to say about this

444
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,300
experiment, like technical
challenges that

445
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,140
you might have faced?

446
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,170
MATIAS: Yeah, the performance.

447
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,940
We tried to run their
location [? U ?]

448
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,920
and had debugged data
from the start.

449
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,270
And it was a set number
of points.

450
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,650
And it went fine all the time.

451
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,290
And then we started trying it.

452
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,640
And it crashed directly because
we were filling it up

453
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,720
too fast, too fast
with points.

454
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,090
But yeah, smart solutions
and limiting the data.

455
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,675
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so all the
coalescence and everything.

456
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:58,080
MATIAS: Yeah.

457
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,945
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

458
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:00,950
Well, it's beautiful guys.

459
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,550
Congratulations.

460
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,050
[LAUGHTER]

461
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:09,967
