Hi! My name is Christian and I am the Product
Manager for Native Client, a technology that

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:12,010
allows you to run native code in the browser
in a safe way. In developer events, I am often

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,330
asked in what ways Native Client can help
developers. In this video, I am going to present

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,220
the most common use cases where our team thinks
Native Client can make a huge difference.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,990
Many developers have large code bases written
in C or C++ and want to use this code to build

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,289
web applications. So, rewriting everything
in JavaScript would take a long time. With

7
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,620
Native Client it is fairly easy to port your
existing code to the web platform.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,090
For example one engineer working at Spacetime
Studios ported Star Legends - an MMO with

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:46,440
half a million lines of code in just 2 weeks!
There are also many cases where an application

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,649
has significant performance requirements.
While we’ve seen amazing improvements in

11
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,219
JavaScript performance the last couple of
years, some applications need all the performance

12
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,030
they can get. Native Client runs native code,
so you can create these performance intensive

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,429
applications for the web.
If you’ve developed a desktop app that you

14
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,850
want to make portable across operating systems,
we believe Native Client can help you out,

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,390
especially if your app performs heavy computation
like many games, photo editing and video editing

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,220
apps. With Native Client you only have to
maintain one code base but your app can run

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,450
on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.
Finally, we understand that for some web apps

18
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,070
you may prefer to write parts of them in languages
other than JavaScript. Native Client currently

19
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,920
has the tools that allow you to write web
applications that run C and C++ code in the

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,200
browser. Mono also works on Native Client,
so you can run the .NET family of languages,

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,280
such as C#. And in the future we’ll work
to support even more languages.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,610
These are the most common use cases where
we believe Native Client can be helpful for

23
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,680
developers. If you are interested in learning
