00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,790
BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,880
interesting developer community.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,710
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,990
has asked this question.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,149
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,440
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
answer show, so if any of you
out there would like to ask

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,810
questions--

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,030

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,580
ERIC GILMORE: Hello, I'm Eric
Gilmore, technical writer with

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,790
the Google Drive SDK.

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,210
Here with me today is
Claudio Cherubino.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,610
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Hi.

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,750
ERIC GILMORE: Claudio is going
to talk to us a little bit

16
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,230
about an application that he's
discovered recently, and we're

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,390
going to review it.

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Thank you, Eric.

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,170
Today, we're going to talk about
Neutron Drive, which is

20
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,220
a web editor that uses Google
Drive for storage that is

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,430
available on the Chrome
Web Store.

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,590
This web editor is targeted to
developers, and it has support

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,030
for many different programming
languages.

24
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,120
What's cool is that you store
your files on the cloud so

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,340
that you can edit those files
wherever you are, from many

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,400
computers, and your files are
always there updated.

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Let's show it so we can
talk over it while

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,870
we see all the features.

29
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,770
Obviously, we're going to
show all the features.

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,180
We also found some room
for improvement.

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,990
The goal of this session,
obviously, is to tell

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,180
developers out there how to
improve their applications and

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,080
how to provide their users
with the best experience.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,360
So nothing major from
Neutron Drive.

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
It's actually a very good
application, but we still have

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,710
some minor suggestions.

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,040
Let's see how to get started.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,540
Eric, can you start
showing where do

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,160
you get Neutron Drive?

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,520
ERIC GILMORE: Maybe we
should start right in

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,770
the Chrome Web Store.

42
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,420

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,080
We can get a drive collection
here in the Chrome Web Store

44
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,550
and see only apps that--

45
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,500
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So there's
a collection of Drive

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,110
applications.

47
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,169
You can reach it by going to
the Collections item in the

48
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,290
left side bar and then selecting
Google Drive.

49
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,225
So you can see all the
applications that integrate

50
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:20,570
with Google Drive and Neutron
Drive is one of those.

51
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,410
ERIC GILMORE: I would point out
that it also works just to

52
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,900
put Drive the search box.

53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,220
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

54
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,940
And obviously, you can also
search for the application.

55
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,980
But we know this application's
name.

56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,300
ERIC GILMORE: Let's search
for Neutron Drive.

57
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,902
There it is.

58
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,550
OK, now, Claudio, should
we go ahead and--

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,520
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: If you click
on it, we will see what

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,530
the application does.

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,960
This is their promotional
page.

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,430
You have screenshots.

63
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,690
You have a video.

64
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,080
You have the features.

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,880
And even more important
for many users is

66
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
that you have reviews.

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,750
So you can see what people think
about this application,

68
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,040
if it has good features or not,
and the stars which is a

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
rating, and so on.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,720
As I said, there are
many, many users

71
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,710
using this app already.

72
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,060
There's thousands of users using
Neutron Drive already.

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,350
ERIC GILMORE: You know what I
noticed about this that I

74
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,410
like, Claudio, is that there's
actually a change log

75
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,720
documentation here that
you can look at.

76
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
I assume if you wanted to
upgrade Neutron Drive or if

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,705
you were waiting for a
particular feature or fix, you

78
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,430
could find out about
it right here.

79
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:24,720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,770
And they also have a
website which is

81
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,770
neutron-drive.appspot.com where
you can also see all the

82
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,950
informational URL, so you can
start if you don't want to

83
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,260
start from the Chrome website.

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,880
ERIC GILMORE: Right.

85
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,370
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So how do
we install Neutron Drive?

86
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,870
ERIC GILMORE: Let's go ahead and
pull the trigger and say

87
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,540
Add to Chrome.

88
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,210
There's a little bit of
dissonance there, isn't it?

89
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,640
We're actually adding
this to Drive, but--

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,000
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Do you
need Chrome to use this?

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,780
ERIC GILMORE: I don't
think you do.

92
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,800
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: No, you
don't need Chrome.

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,150
We made this special deal
for Drive applications.

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,010
You can install Drive
applications

95
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,400
from inside any browser.

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,160
Obviously, if you're inside
Chrome, when you install an

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,090
app, it will also show up in
the Chrome New Tab page.

98
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,730
But if you're not in Chrome,
let's say you're using Mozilla

99
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,490
Firefox or Internet Explorer,
you will still install the

100
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,120
application on your
Drive account.

101
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,370
But obviously, there's no New
Tab page that we are aware of.

102
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,640
There will be no link to it.

103
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,920
ERIC GILMORE: That's the main
difference, isn't it?

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,540
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

105
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,790
ERIC GILMORE: OK,
let's click Add.

106
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,990

107
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,760
As you said--

108
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,440
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cute icon.

109
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,790
ERIC GILMORE: --a very cute icon
with some pretty severe

110
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,380
canines shows up on
my New Tab page.

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll go ahead and click that.

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,940
Now I think we're at one of our
first points we'd like to

113
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,930
discuss in terms of places that
Neutron Drive might be

114
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,780
able to improve.

115
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,450
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

116
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,530
As all Drive applications, the
first time you start the

117
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,520
application, it will ask for
access to be able to read and

118
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,970
write resources according to
the application needs.

119
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,190
So every time you start a new
application, every time you

120
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,340
install an application, you have
to carefully read what

121
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,590
the application wants to do
with your files and grant

122
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,710
access or not according
to your needs.

123
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,410
So if we read what Neutron Drive
wants, what do we find?

124
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,890
ERIC GILMORE: It's a fairly long
list, and we can expand

125
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,680
each one of these items.

126
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,130
It wants to view my basic
account information.

127
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,390
That's fairly standard.

128
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,380
I think it'll need that.

129
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,570
It wants to add itself
to Google Drive.

130
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,260
I have no quarrel with
that at all.

131
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,700
It's going to appear in my Open
With and Create menus.

132
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,100
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Which
is what we want.

133
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,075
ERIC GILMORE: Google
Drive integration.

134
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:35,440
That's terrific.

135
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,710
View and manage the files and
documents in my Google Drive.

136
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,990
This is interesting because just
a couple bullets down, we

137
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,060
have View and Manage Google
Drive files that you have

138
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,850
opened or created
with this app.

139
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,350
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

140
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,130
This is something we think
Neutron Drive should change.

141
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,980
When you write an application
that integrates with Google

142
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,320
Drive, you, as a developer,
can select among many

143
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,070
different scopes your
application wants

144
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,320
to be able to access.

145
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,770

146
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,070
There is a wide scope, which is
a full scope, which is the

147
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,080
first one you read, so be able
to manage all the files on

148
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,800
your Google Drive.

149
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,220
When you give access to an
application to all your files

150
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,750
with that scope, you're saying
that the application can read

151
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,850
and write all the files you
have in Google Drive.

152
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,930
ERIC GILMORE: My drive is
your drive, basically.

153
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,440
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yes.

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,170
This is reasonable.

155
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,170
This is legit if the application
has a legitimate

156
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,940
need for it.

157
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,220
So if, let's say, the
application wants to list all

158
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,570
your files, the application is
a file manager, it definitely

159
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,670
needs to be able to read and
write all your files.

160
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,190
If the application is something
else that doesn't

161
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,960
need that, you might want to
restrict the access only to

162
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,830
the files that the application
itself created.

163
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,940
In this case, Neutron Drive is
an editor that allows you to

164
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,560
list all your files in Drive.

165
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,520
So they need the wider access.

166
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,380
They need full access.

167
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,720
But wider access
also includes--

168
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,560
if you have that, you can also
do everything you can also do

169
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,340
with the narrow scope.

170
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,530
So if you request the first
one, you then need to also

171
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,855
request the second one.

172
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:17,290
And this can be confusing
for users.

173
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,320
ERIC GILMORE: I think it might
very well confuse a user who

174
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,950
was studying this closely.

175
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,705
It really just will clean up
the screen a little bit to

176
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,870
remove that one item.

177
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,160
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This dialog
can be a bit scary because,

178
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,620
obviously, the user has to give

179
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,560
access to his own resources.

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,100
They have to be careful.

181
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,660
The bigger the message, the
bigger the list of things the

182
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,140
application can do,
the scarier it is.

183
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,270
So as a developer, you want it
to be as concise as possible.

184
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,510
ERIC GILMORE: This is something
that we promote as

185
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,250
our best practice in our Drive
SDK documentation, too.

186
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,895
Do you mind if I click over to
that for a second, Claudio?

187
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Sure.

188
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,100
ERIC GILMORE: Here in our Drive
SDK, under the section

189
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,620
for building Drive web apps,
we give some authorization

190
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,085
guidance, including
how to choose auth

191
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:04,650
scopes for your app.

192
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,380
We list the scopes that
are available and

193
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,150
give you some details.

194
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,090
We also have a recent video
with Ali Afshar starring.

195
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,270
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

196
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,200
We also cover this in a
recent recording of

197
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
Google Developers Live.

198
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,800
If you want to read the page--

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,830
it's pretty short, so you
can actually read it.

200
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,985
But if you want, you can also
watch this video, and Ali

201
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:28,780
Afshar, one of our teammates,
will go through each of the

202
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,870
available scopes and explain
when you should use it.

203
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,940
ERIC GILMORE: And to quote a
great technical writer, users

204
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,000
more readily grant access
to limited,

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,720
clearly described scopes.

206
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,508
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: What a
great technical writer.

207
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:42,659
ERIC GILMORE: Thank
you, Claudio.

208
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,450
Anyway.

209
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,490
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we also
found another minor thing in

210
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,720
this page, right?

211
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,840
If you select no if you don't
want to run access to the

212
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,600
application?

213
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,290
ERIC GILMORE: That's right.

214
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:53,900
Let's go see.

215
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,260
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: The user can
say no, I don't want to.

216
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,180
And what should happen is that
if you say no to the

217
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,850
application, you should go back
to the previous page, go

218
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,650
back to some other page that
says, well, you didn't grant

219
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,590
access so there's nothing
we can do.

220
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,910
ERIC GILMORE: Some applications
will pop up a

221
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,360
little dialog saying you might
want to reconsider.

222
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,890
We're quite harmless.

223
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,300
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yes.

224
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,560
This is why we want this.

225
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,825
This is why you should
give us access.

226
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,820
This is what you're going
to miss if you

227
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,010
don't give us access.

228
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,120
Instead, what happens here, if
you click, you just get back

229
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,390
to the same page.

230
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,790
So the user has to close
the browser to

231
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,960
get rid of this message.

232
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,653
ERIC GILMORE: That's not
what you want as

233
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:33,550
an application developer.

234
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,260
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But we want
to install Neutron Drive.

235
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,350
It's a nice application,
so let's say we

236
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,480
grant access to it.

237
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,860
ERIC GILMORE: All right.

238
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,110
Access is allowed.

239
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,530

240
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,210
Neutron Drive is opened
in a new tab.

241
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

242
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,950
And what do we see?

243
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,120
ERIC GILMORE: Well,
here's the list of

244
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,150
all my files as promised.

245
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,510
I gave it access as we
just mentioned, and

246
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,750
here they all are.

247
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,780
And also, apparently I am
creating a new file.

248
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,260
I'm in a new file to create.

249
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,240
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,490
Let's create a new file.

251
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,590

252
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,840
Put some interesting content.

253
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,290

254
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,370
More interesting content.

255
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,500
ERIC GILMORE: How's that?

256
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,350
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You're
a tech writer.

257
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,600
You know how to produce that
interesting content.

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
ERIC GILMORE: I have
to be alone in a

259
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,520
cloister or a dark room--

260
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,030
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Oh, yeah.

261
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,010
ERIC GILMORE: --feeling
my angst.

262
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,340
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

263
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,590
Now let's save it.

264
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,500
One of the cool features about
Neutron Drive is that it

265
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,580
auto-saves documents
you're editing.

266
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,375
But this is a totally new file,
so you can also click on

267
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,990
the Force Save button to save
all of the open files.

268
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,340
ERIC GILMORE: Done.

269
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,280
I did not name it, however.

270
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,250
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We didn't
create one from scratch.

271
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,205
So this is actually another
small thing that the

272
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:54,260
application can fix.

273
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,280
So the user is there and
believes that he's already

274
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,990
editing a file, while the user
is not because we didn't

275
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,890
create any file.

276
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,690
So we should make clear that--

277
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,220
I mean, the application says
something like, you should

278
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,440
open a file or create a new one

279
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,540
before you can do anything.

280
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,590
But it still allows users to
type and delete that message

281
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,790
and write the content.

282
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,470
And maybe it's too late when
they realize that the

283
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,950
applications are not
really saving.

284
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,845
ERIC GILMORE: Now, Claudio,
you're more familiar with this

285
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,830
app than I am at this point.

286
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,520
How do I get started
creating a file?

287
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,740
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's say
you want to create a file.

288
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,430
You can also show the Drive
integration from the Drive UI.

289
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,640
ERIC GILMORE: Let's
come over here.

290
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,810
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You probably
have to refresh the

291
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,105
page so the application
gets installed.

292
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:39,140
ERIC GILMORE: Sorry, Claudio.

293
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,410
You're right.

294
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,660
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And then
once the application is

295
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,400
installed, we can open files
from it or create

296
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,810
new files from it.

297
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,600
It should be there.

298
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,250
ERIC GILMORE: It's not.

299
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,050
Should I completely reopen--

300
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,010

301
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,710
and still thinking.

302
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
We're having some

303
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,860
internet access issues.

304
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,490
ERIC GILMORE: Is it possible
that it isn't integrated for--

305
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,310
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: It's
going to be installed.

306
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,340
Let's go back to the app
and show what you

307
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,660
can do with the app.

308
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,130
First of all, I want to
show you what you can

309
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,800
do with this app.

310
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,750
This application supports
opening from there.

311
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,030
So let's say you want to
open a file from there.

312
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,830
So you have the list of files,
but you also have a picker.

313
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,510
So with the picker, what you
see is the complete list of

314
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,950
files in your application.

315
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:42,520
This can be fine, but this
dialog lists all the files you

316
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,330
have in Drive, not just
the supported ones.

317
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,550
So in your Drive, there might
be text files that this

318
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,560
application can open, but there
can also be some files

319
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,260
your application doesn't know
what to do with them.

320
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,610
So I think a better user
experience would be to only

321
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,520
list those files the application
knows it can open.

322
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,820
So what happened if you
want to open one?

323
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,480
ERIC GILMORE: Let's try this.

324
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,250
How about terrier.jpg?

325
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,220
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, which
is clearly an image.

326
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,700
ERIC GILMORE: Let's
see what we get.

327
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,640
My text editor is apparently
trying to

328
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,140
open that image file.

329
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,910
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

330
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,560
As we said, you're going to get
a dialog that says this

331
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,740
file isn't supported.

332
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,560
So you have two options--

333
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,370
open it in Google Docs or try
to open it in Neutron Drive.

334
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,740
This can be the expected
behavior from this app.

335
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,010
I'm not sure this is the best
user experience, though.

336
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,840

337
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,620
You, as a developer--

338
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,830
Neutron Drive definitely knows
this file cannot be opened.

339
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,270
So I would probably just filter
that list from the

340
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,740
picker dialogue and show only
the files we know the

341
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,690
application can open.

342
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,020
ERIC GILMORE: Do you want to
take a quick look at our

343
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,780
picker code sample?

344
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:49,861
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

345
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,980
How do we do that
with the picker?

346
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,760
ERIC GILMORE: Let's come down
here to integrate with the

347
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,820
Drive UI and look at the topic
about opening files, which is

348
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,700
essentially what we do
with the picker.

349
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,790
Down here, there's a
familiar-looking screen, the

350
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,680
one we were just looking at, and
a sample to show how you

351
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
might open that within
a browser.

352
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,980
Here, I wish we had line numbers
and things to show

353
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,710
you, but we will highlight
this line.

354
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,580
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Claudio, but I think this is

355
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,340
the key to filtering
MIME types.

356
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,640
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: It is.

357
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,470
So the picker API is a simple
JavaScript API that you can

358
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,570
embed in your application.

359
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,320
With that, you can open these
dialogs you've seen to open

360
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,720
files, to save files, and to
get images, to get all the

361
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,830
files, but you can also filter
to some specific MIME types.

362
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,580
And this is what I think Neutron
Drive should do.

363
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,460
They should list the file types
they can support and

364
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,680
only show them.

365
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,810
Also because this is what the
application does when you open

366
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,900
a file from the Drive UI.

367
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:01,990
It is not consistent what the
user can do from the Drive UI,

368
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:08,610
where they can only open a text
file and what a user can

369
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,250
do from inside the application
itself from the picker dialog.

370
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,640
I think that it is not bad, but
it has to be consistent.

371
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,250
ERIC GILMORE: By the way, this
example was for an image

372
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,600
editor, so it only does
PNGs, JPGs, and JPEGs.

373
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,850
Logical enough.

374
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,000

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,140
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: What
else can we show?

376
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:38,520
If you go and open the top
menus, you will see that there

377
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,720
are some options to select what
type of file highlighting

378
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,360
we want and so on because this
application is a very powerful

379
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,310
text editor.

380
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,940
So if you want to, you can have
syntax highlighting for

381
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,290
different file types.

382
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,670
If you go to the menu and select
Editor Mode, you will

383
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,350
see that there are many

384
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,120
programming languages supported.

385
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,160
For each of them, you get a
syntax highlighting, which is

386
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,490
very useful as a developer.

387
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,720
If not, you will only get
standard text file.

388
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,900
ERIC GILMORE: This really
is terrific.

389
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,510
Everything under the
sun is in here.

390
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,920
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: From there,
if you close this, from the

391
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,790
same menu, you can also create
a new file, which is what we

392
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,890
wanted to do before, right?

393
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,380
So you open the same menu and
there is a New File option.

394
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,120
ERIC GILMORE: Which menu?

395
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,770
I'm sorry, Claudio.

396
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That menu.

397
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,560
ERIC GILMORE: By the way, can
I do YAML highlighting?

398
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
I may even have a YAML file.

399
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,690
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That is
a pair file setting.

400
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,650
So you select that every
time you open a

401
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,280
file or create a file.

402
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,930
So the second option in this
menu is a new file.

403
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,040
When you do that, you get a
dialog, and you have to

404
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,950
specify a name.

405
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,665
It might be easy to just specify
a name and not an

406
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,920
extension, which is what
we're going to do.

407
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,330
ERIC GILMORE: Correct.

408
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:52,790
Sorry.

409
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,010
I don't want to cause any
difficulties for your test.

410
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,580
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Most users
will open this dialog and

411
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,450
specify a file name, a title,
but not an extension, assuming

412
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:08,470
that the application will know
how to open this file, right?

413
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:15,380
But apparently Neutron Drive
detects what files it can open

414
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,349
by checking the extension
instead of the MIME type.

415
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,470
Or maybe the MIME type is not
set when we created the file.

416
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,880
And so even if we created a file
with Neutron Drive, when

417
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,349
we try to open it back, which
is what is happening right

418
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,505
now, Neutron Drive
believes that the

419
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,470
file cannot be opened.

420
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,290
And actually, if you click on
try to open it anyway, it will

421
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,670
work properly because
this is a text file.

422
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,420

423
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,090
Neutron Drive is capable
of opening it.

424
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,110
So let's add something
and save.

425
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,140
With Neutron Drive, you're going
to have multiple files

426
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,260
open at the same
time with tabs.

427
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,580
So if you want, you can create
a new file, open a file from

428
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,870
your file list, and so on, and
save all of them at the same

429
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,290
time when you work on them.

430
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,350

431
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,690
When you save a file
on Google Drive, we

432
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,950
save multiple revisions.

433
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,130
So we keep track of the changes
you make to the

434
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,690
document, and we call
them revisions.

435
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,040
At any time from inside Neutron
Drive, you can also

436
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,140
see the list of available
revisions and go back in time

437
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,740
and go back to one of those and
see what happened since

438
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,960
then and so on.

439
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,010
So let's say you saved and from
the same menu, which is

440
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,080
the main Neutron Drive
menu, you get a

441
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,330
revision history file.

442
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,250

443
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,420
This will list multiple changes

444
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,460
we made to the document.

445
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,760
For each of them, we can
see what was in that

446
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,010
version of the file.

447
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,290
And if we want to go back in
time, we can just revert to

448
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,210
that revision.

449
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,650
Do you want to open just one
of those just to see?

450
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,900
ERIC GILMORE: Want to revert
back before I--

451
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,620
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's
open it first.

452
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,790
Let's see what happens.

453
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,230
View a revision first.

454
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,600
This is the latest one, right?

455
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,520
ERIC GILMORE: Let's go back.

456
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,890
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So you
go to revision history--

457
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,100
ERIC GILMORE: And it's pretty
remarkable that this is some

458
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,175
nonsense that I typed in the
past five minutes, and there

459
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:17,470
are five revisions here.

460
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:17,820
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

461
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,550
So if you go and click on View
Revision, you will see what

462
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,040
the content was at that time.

463
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,970
And if you like it, if this is
what you were looking for, you

464
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,910
can revert to it and go back to
that version of the file.

465
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,030

466
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,280
Or not.

467
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
ERIC GILMORE: Hang on.

468
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,750
Let's try one more time.

469
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,730
Or do you want to just
try reverting

470
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,730
straight from that menu?

471
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,610
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We can try.

472
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,280
ERIC GILMORE: That's the one
I was trying to get.

473
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,960
I am sure I want to revert, even
without looking at it.

474
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,800

475
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK.

476
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,780
See, there's some minor UI
glitches that we would like

477
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,420
this application to fix.

478
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,600
So you tried to revert to a
revision, and you don't know

479
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,920
if that is working or not.

480
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,860
You click on Revert and you
don't get any visual

481
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,640
confirmation, things like that,
small things that can

482
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,960
make this application
even better.

483
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,270
ERIC GILMORE: Another attempt
just worked, Claudio.

484
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,560
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

485
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,920
Things like that will make
the experience better.

486
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,430
If something fails, they should
be able to catch it,

487
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,890
show a proper error message like
they do, but maybe in a

488
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,510
more friendly way.

489
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,820
Small things, right?

490
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,990
ERIC GILMORE: And this is
a nice-to-have feature.

491
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,820
I think we were demonstrating
it to show what a great

492
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,530
integration they've done with
our revisions collection.

493
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,240
And we would just urge
the developers--

494
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,780
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: If developers
want to learn about

495
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,310
revision, where should
they go?

496
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,910
ERIC GILMORE: We do again have
a topic in the Google Drive

497
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,640
SDK documentation that will
get you up to speed on

498
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,780
managing revisions.

499
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,990
It's brief, short and sweet,
but it links you into the

500
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,480
details that you need--

501
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,100
oh, my word.

502
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,960
That's not good.

503
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,510
Let's find those details.

504
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,866
It's happening to
us too, today.

505
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,180
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
What a great day.

506
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,910
ERIC GILMORE: It's the--

507
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,860
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
It's Monday.

508
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,810
ERIC GILMORE: --phase of
the moon or something.

509
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,000
Here are the details
right here.

510
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,690

511
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This is one
of the things you can do with

512
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,250
the Drive SDK.

513
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,910
You can manage revisions
as well as files.

514
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,010
Any time programmatically, as
you can do from the UI, you

515
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,970
can also manage the content
of previous revisions.

516
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,290
Cool.

517
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,890
There are some other nice
features in Neutron Drive.

518
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:43,340
We're not going through all of
them today, but remember--

519
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,640
let's say, if you go to the
Preference menu and the

520
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,630
Preference option in the menu,
there are some other

521
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,420
preferences you can set that
might be interesting for

522
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,830
developers.

523
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,230
So if you want to use tabs, font
size, what kind of editor

524
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,540
you want to use, and so on.

525
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,240
And also, it supports
keyboard shortcuts.

526
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,860
Fast developers usually
use a lot of keyboard.

527
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,130
So there's a lot of things you
can do as a developer with

528
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,470
Neutron Drive.

529
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:15,400
I think this is an amazing tool
if you want to write code

530
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,070
wherever you are.

531
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,270
What do you think?

532
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,120
ERIC GILMORE: I would
agree with that.

533
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,990
I think if you're an independent
developer or a

534
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,030
developer in a small company,
it could work really well to

535
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,010
use this type of an editor
and use Google

536
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,320
Drive as your storage.

537
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,950
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: This is a
very easy revision control

538
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,150
tool you can have
for your source.

539
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,120
Obviously, there are tools
that do these things

540
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,970
specifically, so there are
revision control tools that

541
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,390
you can use.

542
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,530
You probably need to set
up a server and so on.

543
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,240
But if you want something very
easy to get started with an

544
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,830
editor, this is probably
very good for you.

545
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,540
ERIC GILMORE: And it comes
with all the bells and

546
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,650
whistles that Drive offers
in terms of sharing and

547
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,900
collaborative editing.

548
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Did
we mention it's free?

549
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,240
ERIC GILMORE: Completely free.

550
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,940
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

551
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,640
With that, I think we covered
Neutron Drive.

552
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,630
We know Neutron Drive is active
on Google+, and we are

553
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,590
active as well.

554
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,530
So we would love to hear your
feedback and we would love to

555
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,530
hear feedback from
Neutron Drive.

556
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,670
And if you have any questions
on Drive development, how to

557
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,760
integrate your apps with Drive,
you can get in touch

558
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,040
with us on Google+ or
on Stack Overflow

559
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,970
for technical questions.

560
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,640
They would be very happy
to help you.

561
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,530
ERIC GILMORE: In fact, should I
show on the screen our tag?

562
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,490
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Please do.

563
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,620
ERIC GILMORE: We do have
probably the most important

564
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,210
page in the entire Drive SDK.

565
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,810
Here's how to ask us
a question about

566
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,940
Google Drive SDK.

567
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,570
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And you
probably recognize some of

568
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,760
those faces.

569
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
ERIC GILMORE: There's one
of them right there.

570
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,230
Let's see.

571
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,510
We have Ali Afshar with
15,000 points.

572
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,740
I just got my first
30 the other day.

573
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,490
I'm just starting.

574
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

575
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,720
And with that happy note,
we're done for today.

576
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,990
Thank you very much
for watching us.

577
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,290
See you next time on Google
Developers Live.

578
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,580
Bye.

579
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:30,700
