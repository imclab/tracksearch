00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,033
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:09,067
please welcome the vice president of products
"at Google, Mario Queiroz."

3
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:17,833

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:18,767
Good afternoon.

5
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,067
It's great to be here.

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,733
Really nice.

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:25,067
Welcome to the Brazilian edition
of Google Developer Day.

8
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,233
this fourth edition of 
Developer Day in Brazil.

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:35,200
The number of people interested in attending
our event today was fantastic.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,333
"More than 6,000 people" registered

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,300
to fill the one thousand openings
we had for the event.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,200
So we're really pleased
to see such interest

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,467
in our development platforms.

14
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,933
It's  a shame that we couldn't 
get a few more seats

15
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:53,767
for those who wanted 
to be here with us.

16
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:58,800
We're going to try to get a few 
more chairs in the next hour.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,500
But let's begin with

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,667
let's begin with a little
talking a bit about 

19
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,300
what we're seeing on the internet.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,767
"But, even before talking about that"

21
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:16,133
It's been more than 20 years
since I left Brazil

22
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,200
and that's why it's great to be here

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,333
but I've been keeping up with 
what's going on back home

24
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,300
when there's a game in Brazil

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,933
when theres a world championship

26
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,267
my shirt's still yellow 

27
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:32,033
and I'm proud of the yellow shirt
even when we don't play very well

28
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:35,500
and even when we lost
"to the Netherlands, in June,"

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,900
But there's always another championship

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,700
the next one we'll win
I'm sure.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,100
Speaking a little more seriously

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,533
the Brazilian economy that we 
that I read about

33
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,900
certainly ouside of Brazil itself

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,567
is going through a 
"very, very good period"

35
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,967
a that the Brazilian technological stage
is getting more and more interesting.

36
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,900
what you see in this chart is

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,167
we see 76 million
online users in Brazil

38
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:02,767
that's 

39
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:08,033
Brazil is 5th in world rankings
in terms of the number of online users

40
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:11,300
"and Latin America, too,"
has been growing a lot.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,233
We've seen a 21% growth
according to this source here

42
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:22,100
that the number of online users in Latin
America from May 2009 to May 2010

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,567
"It's the region, it's the geography"
that has grown the most worldwide.

44
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:33,067
And I know that much of the talent

45
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,933
of the engineers of Brazil

46
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,967
of the computer scientists
of Brazil are in this room today.

47
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:42,300
We're really grateful and very
honored that you've chosen 

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,267
to spend the day with us today.

49
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:49,333
I'm going to talk a little about 
sharing our vision with developers.

50
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,167
and I hope that these sessions you'll be

51
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:56,600
participating in today can also be
very advantageous to you

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,833
One request we were showing 
on the screen when you came in

53
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:07,233
is to you turn off the hotspots
from your Androids from your device

54
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,700
during our keynote presentation

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,633
because we're going to do demos

56
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:18,733
that require a network with no fields and 
the demo will run better if you

57
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,633
aren't running hotspots

58
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:25,600
So I ask that you 
follow this request

59
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
And before beginning with 
the keynote presentation

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,567
that I and a few of my colleagues
will give

61
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:31,467
colleagues from Google

62
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:34,100
and also our partners

63
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,567
I'd like to announce to you

64
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,400
I almost made the announcement
I skipped

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,900
I skipped to the next slide; 
some of you may have already seen

66
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,067
a little bit of
what I'm going to talk to you about.

67
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,167
We heard from the developers
of apps for Orkut

68
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,300
I imagine there are quite a few here

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,300
that monetization is very important and
that we didn't have a solution for it.

70
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,033
In August of this year

71
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:02,300
Google bought
a business called Jambool.

72
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,400
that's a business that had and has
a platform for monetization

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,700
And we were really happy 
to be able to announce the support of

74
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,400
"Orkut in Brazil, through Jambool."

75
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,767
and we are announcing this today
here in Brazil

76
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,667
This means that the developers
can add virtual goods

77
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:27,833
quickly to their applications
with low set-up effort

78
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:35,900
some details of today's announcement
is that in addition to the credit card

79
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Jambool of Brazil offers
support for Boleto Bancario

80
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,833
The whole experiece
has been tailored to Portuguese

81
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,700
"Brazilian Portuguese, of course"

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,033
with 24/7 support

83
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:56,033
And all this with a low 10% rate

84
00:04:56,033 --> 00:05:04,200
that allows most of the reciepts to go directly
to the developer and not to Google.

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,233
You can find out more 
information about Jambool

86
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:12,200
in a presentation today here
a presentation called

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,767
The Open and Social Web
that Patrick [inaudible] will give.

88
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,967
We're very happy 
to be able to announce this.

89
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:24,233
But let's get to our main presentation.

90
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:28,300
During the day we'll be talking about
Google's efforts to make sure

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,033
"that the internet with platforms,"

92
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,733
mobile networks

93
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:37,433
and the infrastructure of Cloud computing
are all better and faster

94
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,967
There are big investments in these areas

95
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,267
and we'll cover three topics here
in the keynote.

96
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:47,200
One is Chrome and HTML5

97
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,500
"Then, Eric Tholome, my workmate"
will talk about the infrastructure

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,167
of Cloud Computing.

99
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,100
and then I'll be back to talk about Android

100
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,700
We've got a few demos
we're going to show you

101
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,033
during the presentations
I hope you'll find them interesting.

102
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:09,567
"I'm going to begin, then,"
with Chrome and HTML5

103
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,933
Time spent online

104
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:16,033
The web is really the most important
platform of our generation.

105
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:22,167
You can see that internet use
has more than doubled in the last 5 years

106
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:25,767
We're talking about the period
from 2004 to 2009 here

107
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:31,400
while other platforms
either stalled or even decreased.

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,667
And we see that the web apps 

109
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:42,400
thanks mainly in large part due to 
"HTML5 in the last 18 months, 2 years"

110
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,233
have become much more powerful
in many ways.

111
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:51,733
"New browsers like Chrome,"
or new versions of Firefox

112
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,233
"of Safari, of Internet Explorer 9"

113
00:06:55,233 --> 00:07:00,200
have added HTML5 APIs
if you're using those APIs

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,367
They allow new ways to use
like powerful graphics

115
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,000
integration with the desktop
hardware integration

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,067
we're going to show you
several features

117
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:14,933
in this presentation here
and throughout the day.

118
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:19,233
HTML5 has only been around 
for less than two years

119
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,300
and it keeps gaining ground

120
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,933
This was the situation 18 months ago
looking at support for HTML5

121
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:32,233
"It got off to a good start,"
but was lacking a lot

122
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:36,533
And today
a few short 18 months later

123
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,300
we see this
completely different view

124
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:46,967
On the part of all the browsers support
"for us, for video, for WebGL,"

125
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:52,900
and for web storage
and other areas...

126
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,133
Nevertheless
beyond the browsers

127
00:07:55,133 --> 00:08:01,767
we also see the frequent use
of HTML5

128
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:06,033
by browsers on smartphones.

129
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:09,400
And that's what we're going to talk 
a little more about

130
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,867
about its growth in the mobile field.

131
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:19,967
So the path we've been following 
shows a lot of progress in that area.

132
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,100
"as a result of these changes, many"
developers are looking for the web

133
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,833
looking at the web as a platform
for innovation

134
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,833
And it

135
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,567
Because it

136
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,133
it's important

137
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,300
we see that it's very important
that the web offer

138
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,300
as many features as 
native operating systems

139
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,333
Here we're going to start 
talking now a bit about

140
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,467
specific cases and specfic features

141
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,800
Up to now

142
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,567
the platform was limited with respect to 
that kind of feature.

143
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:53,500
But with HTML5

144
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,133
we keep working

145
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:59,167
"we here at Google, as much as everyone"
"in the community, to improve it"

146
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,300
We're going to begin with graphic support

147
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,967
Games developed and multimedia apps
are now using technologies

148
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,867
"like Canvas, like WebGL"

149
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:15,933
and hardware acceleration
is using more and more GPU

150
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:17,167
"HTML5, since it's "

151
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,333
it has more system operations capacity
available

152
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:25,200
and now we have more and more 
APIs to access a microphone.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,400
to access the harddrive

154
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,333
to access the acclerometer
that every computer has

155
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,800
"for example, within the harddrive"

156
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,600
"So, no"

157
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,967
I'm going to ask my colleague to come up
to talk about hardware access

158
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:48,233
"my friend, Eric Bidelman"

159
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,333
Eric Bidleman

160
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,733
he's on the Google Chrome team

161
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,500
will give a few demonstrations for you

162
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,533
He'll--

163
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,033
He practiced Portuguese a lot 
these last couple of weeks

164
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,433
but he's going to give his presentation
in English.

165
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:05,733
If you have the headsets 
you got when you came in

166
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,800
for simultaneous translation

167
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,200
if you'd rather--

168
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,967
But right now I'm going to call Eric
to come up to give us a few demos.

169
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:14,967
"Please, Eric."

170
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:20,733

171
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,800
"Obrigado, Mario."

172
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,367
"Bom, eu acho que uma das coisas mais "
interesantes do HTML5 é a capacidade grafica.

173
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:30,300
Agora a gente pode
"usar graficos em 2D, 3D  "

174
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,767
e estao acelerados pelo hardware

175
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,533
É bem interesante.

176
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,867
"Bom, eu acho que uma das coisas mais "
interesantes do HTML5 é a capacidade grafica.

177
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,867
Agora a gente pode
"usar graficos em 2D, 3D  "

178
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,333
e estao acelerados pelo hardware

179
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:46,233
e estao acelerados pelo hardware

180
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,567
Se ouviu falar do HTML5

181
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,367
voces devem ter ouvido falar
do canvas tag

182
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,200
O canvas tag com uma só tag

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,167
e umas linhas de Javascript

184
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,733
voce pode servir um conteúdo rico
para os usuários

185
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,700
e é muito interativo.

186
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,067
Deixa mostrar o que é que eu quero dizer.

187
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,467

188
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,833
Bom. Isso está usando o canvas tag

189
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,500
Isso está processando com Javascript

190
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,900
Tem o gosto do filme the Matrix

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,267
se podem recordar desse filme

192
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:13,367
Mas eu interactuo com a mouse
"e quando faço isso, o text"

193
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:14,700
está updating ao vivo.

194
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,467
Tudo isso está usando Javascript no canvas

195
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:21,400

196
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
O que é que podemos fazer
perdão

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,300
Tambem tem jogos
que voce pode fazer com Canvas

198
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,600
E este jogo se chama Galactic Inbox

199
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Está construído à base do Gmail

200
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,067

201
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,867
e eu vou tentar

202
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,000
quando ele mais rapido aqui

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,433
Voces podem ver

204
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:40,100
podem ver que estamos
conectando com a teclagem

205
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,900
estao descendo

206
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,533
nao esta nada lento

207
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43,667
tudo se ve em tempo normal real ao vivo

208
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:47,967
dando tiros no spam quando ele chega
e vem voando.

209
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,700

210
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,433
Aí está o spam

211
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:56,100
Já entenderam como é

212
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,467
Conteúdo interactivo e divertido usando o Canvas

213
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:01,367
Mas podemos continuar mais além disso

214
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,400
Entao isso tambem é o Canvas

215
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,067
mas isso aqui é Canvas 3D

216
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:05,833
"Entao, como mencionou o Mario"

217
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:10,867
podemos ligar com o WebGL 
que usa OpenGL ES2.0 no web

218
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,167
em Javascript

219
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,233
E eu vou mudar para o Chrome

220
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:21,567

221
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,800
Entao este primeiro demo é de uma galería
de fotos

222
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,033
patrocinado pela 
gente lá na Cool Iris.

223
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:30,767
Estes são a mesma pessoal que
desenvolveu app de fotos para o Android

224
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,900
a galería no aparelho Android

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,767
A diferencia aqui é que isto
é um aplicativo da web

226
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,833
Entao eu posso interactuar com ele 
usando eventos por toque

227
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,633
Eu posso pasar por aqui

228
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,433
Voce pode ver uma reflecao linda

229
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:43,567
umas sombras

230
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,033
voce pode magnificar o conteúdo

231
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:46,800
É rápido

232
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,433
Perfome

233
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,867
é porque está usando
hardware acelerado

234
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,500
Um toque bonito que eles fizeram
com esse demo

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,367
foi de conectá-lo com a busca de imagems 
de Google

236
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,000
Está iqual a pegar as coisas no instante

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,800

238
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
e ainda preve no momento atual.

239
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,367
Um grande exemplo de usar WebGL

240
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:11,500

241
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,400
Vamos olhar de outra perspectiva
para presentar o conteúdo

242
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,633
Entao voces podem ver aqui na tela

243
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,333
Aqui tenho uma esfera

244
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,467
Tem muitas fotos cargadas

245
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,700
Eu posso girá-la em real time

246
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,600
"Está indo muito rápido porque, "

247
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,733
está acelerado no hardware.

248
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,567
Mas para dar a prova para voces

249
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:31,533
Eu vou diminuir o tamanho
dessas imagems

250
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,600
e trocá-las por umas

251
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,633
e espero
se tudo sair bem

252
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:36,867
isto vai rodar tao rapido quanto
a aceleracao no hardware

253
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,533
Voces podem ver que a frame rate
baixou um pouco

254
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,133
Isto é porque estamos

255
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,367
temos centenas de fotos

256
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,767

257
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,067
Mais um demo WebGL

258
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,267

259
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:54,000
Espero que isso nao seja
uma imagem da Terra ao vivo

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,333
Mas agora temos um asteroid
caindo na Terra

261
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,033
explodindo

262
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,400
Posso colocar umas a mais

263
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,100
quando entram

264
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,333
Mas se eu realmente quero
fazer um jogo mais interesante

265
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,533
posso adicionar muitos mais

266
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:07,667
E isso está funcionando com 
de novo

267
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,900
está usando aceleração no hardware.

268
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,233
a GPU do computador

269
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,433
Voce pode ver que está
um pouco mais devagar

270
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:13,667
mas
voces podem ver

271
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,133
que estamos batalhando bem forte
com a Terra

272
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,433
Entao é isso WebGL.

273
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:23,433

274
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,233
Como falou o Mario

275
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,800
nao é só de graficos.

276
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,433
Tambem tem acesso ao file e hardware

277
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,000
Entao tem melhor integração com o OS

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,133
As coisa que podiam fazer native
 no aplicativo

279
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,833
voce pode agora fazer na web

280
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,000
Vou mostrar para voces do que 
eu estou falando.

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,600
HTML5 tem a posibilidade de 
fazer drag-and-drop

282
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,167
drag-and-drop native
dentro do navegador

283
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:48,667
Mas tambem pode fazer drag-and-drop
do desktop para o navegador

284
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:52,333
Agora tenho umas imagems aqui
no meu directory local

285
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:57,667
e eu posso agarrá-las 
do Mac para o aplicativo do web

286
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,233
E voce pode ver que aqui estão rendered

287
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,167
Tudo isso usa o file reader API

288
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,800
Eu ja li os files com Javascript
e criei as imagems pequenas

289
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,967
E tomei um paso a mais para

290
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:10,133
fazer umas CSS transforms
e animações

291
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:10,767
Então voce pode criar

292
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:16,100
pode imaginar a criar uma galeria
ou mostrador bem interesante.

293
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,267

294
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,400
Outra coisa que pode fazer
com HTML5

295
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,867
que é ler um diretório enteiro
recursivamente

296
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:26,167
Isto é um input tag simple

297
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:30,567
Ao adicionar a atributa do directório
voce pode fazer

298
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,167
algumas coisas incríveis

299
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:35,800
Entao aqui neste demo
tehno um file picker

300
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,033
Posso escolher uma só ficha

301
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,600
Posso escolher um diretorio enteiro

302
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,333
E eu

303
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,167
o que ganho é que eu posso
ler o diretório enteiro recursivamente

304
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,233
Talvez voce tenha
um MP3 ou tipo assim

305
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,100
Poderosos resultados
com a mínima de code

306
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,867

307
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,767
Vamos voltar para ver isso 
em full screen

308
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:56,367

309
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:59,300
Outro modo de ligar com
o hardware é com a voz

310
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,667
Claro que temos a teclagem
para interactuar

311
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,233
mas agora temos a possibilidade
de usar a voz para input

312
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,933
para fazer coisas diferentes
com a accesibildade

313
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,567
E agora é assim que a gente
ve google.com

314
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,733
ao menos na liga dos dot com

315
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,600
E voce pode ver que
tem algo diferente com isso aqui

316
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,233
"Então, no canto direito dessa caixa de "
entrada tem um microfonezinho.

317
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,133
"E, claro que eu posso teclar aqui"
na caixa e fazer a busca

318
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:23,133
ou posso usar o microfone.

319
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,767

320
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:31,667
"Sheraton Hotel, São Paulo, Brazil"

321
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,700
Entao ao usar uma só atributa

322
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,167
não tem nada de Javascript aqui

323
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,700
voce pode ver que fez umas pesquisas
"de voz para mim, em tempo real."

324
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,267
Muito legal.

325
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:46,367

326
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,167
O últiimo demo que vou mostrar 
é um API para a orientação do aparelho.

327
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,833
e isto é para mim uma das coisas
mais interesantes

328
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,767
Entao voce pode ver ums
numeros mudando na tela

329
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:57,800
e é porque esta mesa
não esta nivelado

330
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,133
Mas isto esta lendo
os dados do acelerometro do laptop

331
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,733
E com umas linhas breves de Javascript

332
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,833
Eu posso aplicar a transformação CSS
neste div aqui

333
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,800
e vou mostrar para voces como é

334
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,833
"Bom, eu posso tentar nivelar isto"

335
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,967

336
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,200
muito legal

337
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,900
[aplausos]

338
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,133
Esperem.
Tem mais.

339
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:28,133
"Bom, isto é o Chrome do Google"
uma marca que todos chegamos a amar

340
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:28,933
Voces viram isso no div

341
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:30,833
mas pode ir um paso mais alem

342
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,067
e fornecer um contúdo
bem interativo para os usuários

343
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:41,600
Isto tambem usa tranformações de CSS3
e a API da orientação do aparelho

344
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,367
E voce tem

345
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,033
e pode ver o z index aí.

346
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:47,900
Muito legal.

347
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,133
Para terminar com HTML5

348
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,833
reconhecemos que temos capacidade
de video

349
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,100
temos o canvas tag para graficos

350
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,467
e combinando tudo isso podemos
incorporar uma biblioteca de fisica

351
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,033
uma biblioteca de fisica por Javascript

352
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:05,100
e o API da orientacao do aparelho

353
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,433
[musica]

354
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:12,967
Entao isto é o video do HTML5
reproduzido nos blocos individuais

355
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,533
E usando o API da orientação do aparelho

356
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,400
Eu posso virar o mundo

357
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,067
[musica]

358
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:22,533
Bem legal.

359
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,833
E voce pode ver que o video
ainda toca emquanto eu fizer isso.

360
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,867
Isto tudo esta  acontecendo em tempo real
usando HTML5

361
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,367
usando Javascript

362
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,467
usando a orientação do aparelho
e Canvas

363
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,367
Vamos ver isso de novo

364
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,133
E tao legal.

365
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,067
Levanta e deixa cair

366
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:44,700
Bem bacana

367
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,500
Entao é tudo para mim.

368
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,233
Vou devolver o palco ao Mario

369
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:59,300
[aplausos]

370
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,333
So we're really
very excited

371
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,067
with our demos and 

372
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:07,233
with lots of other things
that we see happening

373
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,767
with the new APIs.

374
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:14,567
But every good thing has its challenges.

375
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:21,433
And we think that we understand
many of the challenges faced 

376
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,333
by developers like you for web apps

377
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,433
that's another reason to have an event
like this one to talk with you

378
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:31,000
and understand what you 
most want to work on 

379
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,033
with Google and how you
want to work with these APIs.

380
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:39,400
"Specifically, three of the challenges"
we see are in the area of ...

381
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,733
"First, the discovery of web apps."

382
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,567
There is
so much interest

383
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:48,333
"there are so many applications that you, "
want to know how to reach

384
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,000
the greatest number of users.

385
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,467
So that users can 
discover your applications.

386
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,200
And when the user discovers
an application

387
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,200
you want the user to continue
to rediscover that application

388
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,533
and use it more and more.

389
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:09,233
You want to know how to survive
doing what you adore doing

390
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,067
what you love to do
which is programming.

391
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:14,033
And so monetization is very importnat.

392
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:17,200
We took these considerations
into account

393
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,367
we kept this in mind in order to project
and build our online store for Chrome.

394
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,500
We still have a...

395
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,367
We still don't have a version
"to share with you,"

396
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,900
but we're working

397
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,767
to fix these challenges that I'm talking
about making the applications

398
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:40,400
easier to be discovered and
"make rediscovery easy,"

399
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,767
the reuse of the application.

400
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:46,400
And also to make it possible

401
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,667
for the paid applications
as much as for the free applications.

402
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:57,667
You can get ready for when
the store opens at the end of this year.

403
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:02,867
There's not much time left to create
and upload your web apps

404
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:05,867
on the Chrome developer dashboard.

405
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:09,933
And we hope 
that the development of Chrome

406
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,200
of the Chrome store

407
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,367
of the Chrome store is as successful as 
the development 

408
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:20,000
of the browser itself
has been.

409
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,433
We see

410
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:27,100
we saw the Chrome browser surpass
more than 70 million users worldwide.

411
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,667
that's a big number and the rate 
of growth is really very fast.

412
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,900
I want to also mention that Brazil

413
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,933
is the second country in the world
in numbers of adopters of Chrome

414
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:41,400
in absolute volume of the adoption
of Chrome.

415
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,767
that is something that makes us
very proud.

416
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,833
So the web platform
really is the most powerful

417
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,933
plaform today
with the advances in HTML5.

418
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,133
And we're very 

419
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,300
we will continue to invest a lot in this area

420
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,867
to continually improve
"the Chrome browser, and all of"

421
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,033
all the features
that we've shown here.

422
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,967
that we're going to demonstrate today

423
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:07,967
"as much for the users, of course,"
that the most important thing

424
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,500
is that we deliver
applications that are

425
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,333
good for the users.

426
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,133
"But, of course, also "
for you.

427
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:20,633
"And now, let me introduce "
our second keynote speaker.

428
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,300
Eric Tholomé.

429
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,833
He's going to show you
what we're doing in the area

430
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,400
of cloud computing infrastructure.

431
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,433
Eric and I worked together
in Europe a long time ago.

432
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,700
He tried to teach me French.

433
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,933
it didn't work very well.

434
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,233
I tried to teach him Portuguese.

435
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,767
"That didn't work very well, either."

436
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:43,167
His Portuguese
is much better than my French.

437
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:44,667
But he'll also give his talk in English.

438
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:50,833
"So at this time, if you want to use "
the headsets to hear his presentation

439
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,833
you can.

440
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,067
"So, Eric, please."

441
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:59,067
[applause]

442
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,233
"Bom dia, todos."

443
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:05,467
"Estou muito, muito alegre"
de estar aqui hoje em Sao Paulo

444
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,300
e dá muita emoção 
ver tantos de voces.

445
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,900
Eu vi algumas pessoas já nos corredores
às 7:30 da manhã.

446
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,000
É impresionante.

447
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,567
"Obrigado pela sua interês, "
sua paixão pela web.

448
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:26,300
Mario falou de quanto rápido está
desenvolvendo os browsers e as normas

449
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,633
"E, como voces sabem, quando voce"
cria um aplicativo para a web

450
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:33,100
precisa de browsers e código front-end

451
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,400
mas tambem precisa de servidores e redes
para entregar a parte back-end.

452
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,167
E geralmente referimos a essas coisas
como cloud computing.

453
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,767
"Por isso, vou tomar ums minutos"
para falar de

454
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:50,967
como está desenvolvendo esse mundo
muito rápido e emocionante.

455
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:55,233
"Mas primeiro, vamos dar uma olhada"
de onde todos chegamos.

456
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,567
E não vou falar de macacos

457
00:23:57,567 --> 00:24:00,400
nem todos estão de acordo que
descendemos de macacos.

458
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,167
Eu quero falar de computadores.

459
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:05,867
"E, se recordam,"
tudo começou com os mainframes.

460
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:10,700
Se olham para
toda a inovacao que aconteceu

461
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,967
e que tem criado o mundo em que
"vivemos hoje, que veem na tela"

462
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:17,167
e se voces pensam na velocidade

463
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,300
no aumento de poder do CPU

464
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,833
e o tamanho da memoria que temos visto

465
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:27,400
cada 10 anos pasamos por 
uma revolucao no mundo de computar.

466
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,433
E essa revolucao tem
mudado dramaticamente cada vez

467
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:34,633
o método de criar aplicativos.

468
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:37,433
"E, como voces todos sabem, "
se estao aqui hoje

469
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:42,833
a revolucao mais recente
que estamos pasando é o cloud computing.

470
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:46,967
É essa a promesa que voces
nao vao ter que preocuparse

471
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:50,533
com RAM e CPU e discos
e tal.

472
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:55,500
E voce vai poder comprar
e consumir a computacao pela internet.

473
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:04,400
Igual a que voces compram os mp3
ou camara digital ou brinquedos online.

474
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,767
Na Google

475
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,733
para fazer com que essa promesa
se realize

476
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:14,400
"no ano 2008, lançamos um produto"
chamado Google App Engine.

477
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,700
A promesa que o Google App Engine
entrega é para fazer muito mais facil

478
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,800
e mais rápido construir seus aplicativos;

479
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,100
para dirigir seus aplicativos

480
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,000
para escalar seus aplicativos

481
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,500
Quando voce usa o App Engine

482
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,733
ou se voce somente escreve programacao

483
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:35,833
Voce nao tem que preocuparse com RAM
e CPU e discos

484
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,433
e um monte de hardware
agora.

485
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:43,133
Quando voce estiver pronto
"basicamente, aperte o botao"

486
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,900
e aí voce tem um aplicativo

487
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,633
Está vivo

488
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:46,333
É escalável.

489
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,700
Está no internet

490
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,300
E nao ha nada com que se preocupar
em termos de manutenção ou escalabilidade.

491
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,633
Estou alegre para reportar
que durante os últimos dois anos e meio

492
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,800
desde que o App Engine naceu

493
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,433
temos visto crecimento muito grande.

494
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:14,133
"Nesses días, ums 90 mil desenvolvedores"
usam o App Engine no mundo enteiro.

495
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:22,633
Eles tem construido ums 130 mil
aplicativos que estao vivos cada dia.

496
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:28,867
"e servem mais de 5,5 bilhões de"
páginas vistas cada semana.

497
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:32,300
Esses são números impresionantes.

498
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,800
"E para nós no Google,"

499
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,267
"particularmente o time de App Engine,"

500
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:40,800
"tem sido muito, muito gratificante"
ver tantos novos websites

501
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,700
tantos novos aplicativos

502
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,133
tantos novos negocios aparecerem

503
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:50,833
e serem mais rápido à inovação
"e ao mercado, graças ao App Engine."

504
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,967
E a grande coisa é que isso
está acontecendo por tudo o mundo.

505
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:57,667
Mas tambem um pouco disso
está acontecendo aqui no Brasil.

506
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:01,467
Tem histórias de sucessos estupendos
vindo do Brasil.

507
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:04,033
E quero convidar o Marcelo Marzola

508
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:08,333
o CEO e um dos fundadores da Predicta
e BTBuckets

509
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:13,200
para participar no palco e falar para nós
e para voces de sua história de sucesso.

510
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,233
Marcelo Marzola

511
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:22,933
[applause]

512
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,767

513
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,333
"Thank you, Eric."

514
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,767
You're welcome.

515
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:31,133

516
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,100
"Hello, everyone."

517
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,233
Hello.

518
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,367
Hello.

519
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,267
"In Portuguese, a little, now."

520
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:37,100
My name is Marcelo.

521
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,933
I'm the CEO of Predicta.

522
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:42,133
We are a business that develops
technology for online marketing.

523
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,867
We've got 10 years of stories.

524
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:47,233
We are 120 professionals in the business today.

525
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:50,300
And I have to say that it's my 
pleasure to work every day

526
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,900
with some of the best
developers in Brazil.

527
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Some of them are here.

528
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,933
Buyt I didn't come to talk with you
today about Predicta.

529
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,833
"I wanted to alke about our youngest child,"
BTBuckets.

530
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:05,000
an experience that was born 
from inside Predicta

531
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,333
more or less at the same time that
cloud computing history began

532
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,667
to happen around the whole world.

533
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,400
We wanted to have some experience
with cloud computing

534
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,667
so we took
one of our areas of expertise

535
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:18,267
that's a business called
behavioral segmentation

536
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:22,567
and we went looking for a structure 
for cloud computing

537
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,133
that could handle this platform.

538
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:30,867
We came to App Engine more or less
at the same time that App Engine was born.

539
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:33,200
To tell our story of...

540
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,867
"Preciso dos diapositivos, por favor..."

541
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,567
to the the strory of

542
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,800
"of how BTBuckets grew,"

543
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,933
I decided to call my friend 
that you see on the screen.

544
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:47,433
And I wanted to ask if anyone
knows who that guy is on the screen?

545
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:51,700
Raise your hand if you know him.

546
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,167
No?

547
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:52,567
No one?

548
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,400
What's his name?

549
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,500

550
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,867
Wagner.

551
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,200

552
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,733
This is Wagner.

553
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:03,967
Wagner is one of our 
infrastructure engineers.

554
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,567
He's been working with us for 5 years

555
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:07,333
and two weeks ago

556
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,133
Wagner came up to me and said...

557
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:14,000
"he stopped me in the hallway and said,"
"Marcelo, I'm leaving the company."""

558
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,267
[He rolled his eyes]

559
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:17,233
"I love this company,"

560
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,333
"I love what I do, but I feel like"
you're paying me 

561
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,233
for something I'm not doing.

562
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:26,300
So I think it's best if I leave the company.

563
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,600
I took my phone out of my pocket

564
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,533
and took a picture of him.

565
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,867
He understood that...

566
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:34,267
This is the photo.

567
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,233
"I asked him,"
"""Can I use your photo on a DVD?"""

568
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,367
"He said, ""Sure."""

569
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:40,433
And that's why it's there.

570
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:44,000
Our online infrastructure engineer.

571
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,567
Infrastructure engineers are important
because they bring credibility 

572
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:49,633
to the infrastructure.

573
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,467
And when you're selling applications

574
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,967
when we developers 
are selling applications

575
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:55,833
coming to clients

576
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:59,067
conferring credibility
in the infrastructure is important.

577
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:00,333
And to pass on the credibility

578
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,300
we had to arrive with a speech
more or less like this

579
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,233
[ ] seen some place.

580
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:11,533
"Or, then, a diagram of a complicated "
network like this.

581
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:16,267
"Today, when we want to pass along credibility,"
what we do is show a turbine.

582
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:20,733
A turbine is universal.

583
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,733
We manage to meet with 
clients from all around the world

584
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:26,600
and show them that we use 
App Engine and know that

585
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,100
that client has faith
in the structure we're using

586
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,967
"to run our application,"
our platform.

587
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,967
"Credibility is important, but "
it isn't everything.

588
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,167
We also have to 
"look at profitability, too."

589
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,267
"So, for the two indicators"
of profitability

590
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:43,667
that for any one who works with
developers are important.

591
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,367
"On the left, we talk "
about development time

592
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,500
"on the right, we talk"
about cost.

593
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,233
To build an infrastructure
"for one of our platforms,"

594
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:54,000
"throughout our business,"
we discovered that we took

595
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,633
more or less about 10 months.

596
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,167
"With App Engine, we managed"
to use more or less

597
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:03,167
2 months of time
for infrastructure development.

598
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,767
"Oh, another important thing:"

599
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:08,167
when I talk about development
I'm talking aobut the whole process

600
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,467
from application

601
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,233
building the infrastructure

602
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,100
and everything else.

603
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,767
But with App Engine

604
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,267
a real case that happened
with us 

605
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:17,900
more or less about 
2 or 3 months ago

606
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,667
we reached our allotment limit
for App Engine.

607
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,833
We brought up the form;

608
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:23,767
we filled in the form.

609
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:26,200
"We said, ""Everyone, we've blown our limit."

610
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,300
We need more computational power.

611
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,600
"The next day,"

612
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,600
"less than 24 hours,"

613
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,700
our infrastructure capability
had been multiplied by four.

614
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,333
For anyone here
who has an application

615
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,600
who's already run a data center

616
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,833
who's already managed a data center

617
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,267
We at Predicta
have managed many

618
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,700
you know how complicated
and different this is.

619
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,067
when you're running 
your own infrastructure.

620
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:52,033
Cost of development

621
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,600
"300 thousand reais, more or less, "
to put up a cool infrastructure.

622
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,900
to run a web application
with quality

623
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,967
low maintenance

624
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,633
good response time

625
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:03,467
Using App Engine:
15 thousand reais.

626
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:07,733
15 thousand reais is more or less
I think I can say that it's

627
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:10,867
an amount of money that any one of us
here in this room could raise

628
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:15,400
to build an application and get
something running on the web.

629
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,467
From 300 to 15 thousand.

630
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,667
Global reach.

631
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:22,600
Global reach.

632
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,933
It's not setting up a data center
here in Brasil

633
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,233
to serve Brasil.

634
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:27,067
You can serve the whole world.

635
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,267
And when we say
the whole world

636
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:33,067
this is a map of worldwide users 
of BTBuckets today

637
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:36,600
And I think that that's what we try
"to do with developers,"

638
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,300
like Brazilians

639
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,600
"and as developers, take"
the name of Brazil

640
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,533
out and take our

641
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,100
thake the quality of our movement out.

642
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,233
And so I invite you
to also use App Engine

643
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:50,067
and take Brazil's name out.

644
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,167
That's what I wanted to say to you.

645
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:51,967
Thank you.

646
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:52,900
Great.

647
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,500

648
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
"Thank you, Marcelo."

649
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,533
"Espera. Espera, espera."

650
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:03,967
Acabei de encontrar você no nosso
sistema interna esta manhã

651
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:07,933
e você não é somente um dos nossos
"clientes mais grandes no mundo,"

652
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:11,967
mas acabei de descubrir que você é o nosso cliente
mais grande no Brasil para o AppEngine.

653
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,100
Já sabía disso?

654
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,333
"Não, não sabía."

655
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,433
Quando foi que vocês lançaram o BTBuckets?

656
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:21,967
Mais ou menos há 18 meses

657
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:26,433
Estes caras tem ido de zero
ao mais grande cliente do AppEngine

658
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,000
no Brasil em 18 meses.

659
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,567
Isso é incrível.

660
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,033
Parabems.

661
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,433
Thank you.

662
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:35,067
[aplausos]

663
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,467

664
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:40,833
Vocês acabaram de ouvir de Marcelo
"numas historias muito precisas, verdadeiras"

665
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:46,200
como é que AppEngine fez dirigir
um negocio com mais facilidade.

666
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,833
Se você perguntar aos
CIOs e administradores de IT

667
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:57,333
eles vão dizer que gastam mais ou menos
60% do custo em manutenção.

668
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,933
em que chamamos de manter as luzes acesas

669
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,433
de consertar as falhas dos servidores
e hardware

670
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:08,100
em applicar remendos 
que pode receber cada X semanas

671
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,067
Não sería bom se pudesse
usar todo esse dinheiro

672
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,267
todo esse investimento para inovação?

673
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:16,067
Se pudesse injectar esse 60%
em desenvolvimento

674
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:19,400
em vez de gastá-lo
em manutenção?

675
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
A outra coisa que é muito bom é que
com AppEngine

676
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,667
você pode inovar mais rápido

677
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:28,000
porque está focado no
"código, em vez do resto."

678
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,600
Mas a grande coisa é que
o próprio AppEngine faz invovação muito rápido

679
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,900
E vou tomar ums minutos para
falar de algumas dessas coisas grandes.

680
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,100
que vão chegando no AppEngine.

681
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,533
"Primeiro, para demostrar"
quanto rápido muda a plataforma.

682
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,200
Não faz mais de ums meses atrás

683
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,533
lançamos a funcionalidade de namespaces.

684
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:53,867
"Com isso, trazemos novas capacidades"
que permitem multi-tenancy em AppEngine.

685
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:55,233
E se olhamos para o futuro

686
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:59,200
aquí estão algumas das coisas 
que vão chegar no AppEngine.

687
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,867
Apoio completo para MapReduce.

688
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:07,400
Isso significa computação paralela
diretamente do AppEngine.

689
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,300
Importar e exportar em grande quantidade
do datastore

690
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:16,067
para que possa mais facilmente
transferir seus dados para o AppEngine.

691
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,933
quand faz rodar o aplicativo.

692
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,333
E tambem tirar os dados quando for necesario.

693
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:25,667
"""reserved instances' vai "
deixar reservar os instantes

694
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:30,000
"como diz o nome, para asegurar"
que o seu app sempre responde

695
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,700
o mais rápido posível
a um pedido de qualquer usuário.

696
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:40,033
Servidores de fundo vão deixar que as funções
continuam a funcionar por um peridodo indefinido

697
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:45,067
em vez de parar
por causa dos time-outs da plataforma.

698
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,833
Com a API RealTime Channel

699
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,767
você recebe uma maneira muito interesante
para que o seu app interactue

700
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,867
"com o usuário usando ""browser push"""

701
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:55,133
você pode atuar com os usuários 
no momento

702
00:35:55,133 --> 00:36:01,933
que dá outras posibilidades 
de comunicação.

703
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:07,167
"E, finalmente, vamos adicionar"
o suporte para OpenID e OAuth.

704
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,800
Essas são duas especificações emergentes
que são cada vez mais importantes

705
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,467
quanto à autenticação.

706
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,600
E tudo isso é muito estimulante.

707
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,200
Tambem percebemos que quanto mais
os desenvolvedores e negocios dependem do AppEngine

708
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,233
como o BTBuckets

709
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,400
é importante que alcançamos
suas normas

710
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,900
e novas necesidades chegam.

711
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,267
É por isso que no Maio
deste ano no Google IO

712
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,567
anunciamos Google AppEngine
para Negocios.

713
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:44,300
E desde então estivemos trabalhando
muito para fazê-lo disponível

714
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,967
O AppEngine para Negócios é...

715
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,200
"Basicamente, "
cria na mesma plataforma.

716
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,533
É o AppEngine que já conhecem.

717
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:55,967
Entrega na promesa
"de fazer fåcil a construção,"

718
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,867
"a manutenção, e a escalabilidade"
dos aplicativos.

719
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,200
Mas tambem

720
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,500
AppEngine para Negócios vai trazer
um acordo de nível de serviços

721
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,933
"É, basicamente, escrevendo com palavras"
"que os advogados gostam, nosso compromiso"

722
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,167
que vocês conhecem bem

723
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:15,167
de colocar à disposição os produtos
de alta disponibilidade.

724
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,467
AppEngine para Negócios
vem com suporte profesional

725
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:21,433
porque quando o seu negócio
começa a contar com um produto

726
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:22,167
como o AppEngine

727
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:25,133
é importante saber
que podem comunicar com a gente

728
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:29,567
e que tem um tempo de resposta
garanitda.

729
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,967
App Engine para Negócios
vem com Hosted SQL

730
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,167
porque sabemos 
que muitos desenvolvedores

731
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:42,333
conhecem e realmente gostam da SQL particularmente
no mundo enterprise para aplicativos internas.

732
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:46,367
App Engine para Negócios terá uma 
caracteristica de seguridade by default

733
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:50,000
Isso quer dizer que se você está montando
um aplicativo interno

734
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,267
a plataforma si mesma vai garantir

735
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,333
que somente os seus funcionarios vão ter
acesso aos aplicativos internos.

736
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:58,333
Não vai ter que preocuparse 
com autenticação ou leaks.

737
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:02,633
O normal será que seus aplicativos
estarão seguros no seu domínio.

738
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:06,767
"Da mesma maneira, você vai poder"
usar SSL com seu domain

739
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:11,733
para que os dados da companhía para
seus aplicativos serão cifrados

740
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:15,633
desde os navegadores dos usuários
até o seu aplicativo.

741
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:21,767
"E, finalmente, o App Engine para Negócios"
vem com um console de administração

742
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,233
Parece assim.

743
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:27,233
Quando você é um CIO
ou um administrador de IT

744
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:32,800
"você tem dezenas, centenas, e"
"às vezes, miles de aplicativos."

745
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,533
E se tem plataformas múltiples
e servidores múltiples

746
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:40,367
pode ser muito complexo
para controlar tudo isso.

747
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:42,600
Quando usam App Engine 
para Negócios

748
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,300
você tem um lugar central
para configurar

749
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,033
e controlar o acesso 
e politicas de seguridade.

750
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:54,300
É isso que o Console de Administração
tenta fazer.

751
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,867
"Então, o Cloud é maravilhoso."

752
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,133
Você pode prestar atenção na inovação.

753
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,367
Tudo mundo está feliz.

754
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:05,467
Mas normalmente tem uma pergunta
que tem as pessoas.

755
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:09,200
"É, 'Bem, você sabe,"
é seguro escholher O Cloud?'

756
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,333
Estou pronto para O Cloud?

757
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,167
O Cloud está pronto para mim?

758
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,600
"E se eu trocar de idéia, sabe, "

759
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,067
qual é a segurança que tenho 
se quero sair do seu Cloud

760
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,600
ou um Cloud qualquer
eu vou poder sair?

761
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,667
E isso é uma boa pergunta.

762
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:24,833
"Quero dizer, quantos de vocês podem dizer"
que nunca estiveram trancados dentro da tecnología

763
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,300
sem perceber?

764
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,967
Você para de construir usando linguagem
nas plataformas grandes ou com ferramentas

765
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,333
e daí você percebe que
se quer mudar de idéia

766
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,000
é difícil.

767
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,167
Levanta a mão
se isso nunca aconteceu com você.

768
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,667
Não vejo nenhuma mão.
Uau

769
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,800
Achei que algumas pessoas
pensam que nunca acontecería com eles.

770
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,300
É por isso que

771
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,733
"no Google, um dos prinípios fundamentais"
de design

772
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,633
e isso é verdade para todos os produtos
do Google

773
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:54,700
e é bem verdade no caso do nosso
produto de cloud computing

774
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,800
App Engine.

775
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,767
Concentramos na transparencia de informação

776
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,467
Aonde for e quando for posível

777
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,900
Usamos padrões abertos

778
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,267
para que vocês possam levar seu app

779
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:14,233
"o seu código, e seus dados com vocês."

780
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:16,133
Na verdade gente vai mais além dos padrões

781
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:19,733
Padrões são uma boa base para isso

782
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:20,633
Mas o que temos feito

783
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:24,700
é que trabalhamos com as ferramentas
de desenvolvimento

784
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:31,033
e com os nossos porters para entregar
o que chamamos de portabilidade de cloud.

785
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:34,300
A idéia de portabilidade de cloud

786
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,900
é que pode montar seu app
sem ter que preocuparse com

787
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,767
que vai lançá-lo no nosso cloud

788
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:43,233
"num outro cloud, ou na premise."

789
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,000
E é somente na hora de lançar 
que você escolhe

790
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,067
onde você quer lançar e
pode mudar de idéia.

791
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:53,933
É essa a máxima promessa
de portabilidade e abertura de cloud.

792
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:59,433
Quero tentar ser um pouquinho
mais específico com essa situação.

793
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:03,800
Provavelmente estão perguntando por que
estão vendo vinho e queijo.

794
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,267
A razão principal
"é que, como falou Mario,"

795
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:11,700
"sou francês, e isso é uma promoção"
dos produtos melhores do meu país.

796
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,633
Estou tentando
fazer uma comparação aquí

797
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:17,500
e tinha outra opção
que foi colocar um campo de futebol

798
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,333
mas pensei com mil brasileiros
e somente eu

799
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,300
a única pessoa francês

800
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,767
que provavelmente sería um pouco arriscado.

801
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:30,400
"Inclusive, eu ainda recordo"
a Copa Mundial com muita dor.

802
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,100
Então escolhí vinho e queijo.

803
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:38,667
E o que quero dizer com vinho e queijo
é que você conhece o grande sabor de vinho

804
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:41,067
e tambem o sabor delicioso de queijo.

805
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:45,533
Mas quando você come as duas coisas juntas
é ainda muito melhor.

806
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:50,967
"Bem, foi exatamente isso que aconteceu"
quando encontramos com a gente de VMWear

807
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,667
"no ano passado, mais ou menos um ano atrás."

808
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,967
E acabaram de adquirir o Spring.

809
00:41:54,967 --> 00:42:00,500
E o VMWear e o Spring são dois líderes
em desenvolvimento de software de empresa.

810
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:08,167
"E vimos que tinham fabricado, êles e nós, "
umas ferramentas incríveis para desenvolver

811
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,567
que separados eramos muito boms

812
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,367
mas se combinamos os dois juntos

813
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:12,700
se integramos os dois

814
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,667
resultaría uma coisa
ainda melhor.

815
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:19,267
As ferramentas a quais estou referindo
"são o Google Web Toolkit,"

816
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,867
que é uma ferramenta muito útil

817
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:26,100
para construir e montar a parte front-end
de um site usando a linguagem Java

818
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,600
e SpringRoo.

819
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,967
SpringRoo é a ferramenta de desenvolvimento
para montar os back-ends de negócios.

820
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,867
E como podem imaginar

821
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:37,367
se juntam os dois
e fazer com que eles se emendam

822
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:40,433
o resultado é um ambiente de desenvolvimento
bem facinante

823
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:44,800
para criar um aplicativo
bom e moderno para o web.

824
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,533
E é isso em que trabalhamos quando
nos conhecemos mais ou menos um ano atrás

825
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:54,767
E estou muito emocionado 
para anunciar que a partir de ontem

826
00:42:54,767 --> 00:43:00,433
as novas versões dessas ferramentas
funcionam juntas e estão geralmente disponíveis.

827
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:03,733
E para fazer ainda mais específico
do que vinho e queijo

828
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:05,733
eu vou convidar o Chris Reimsdale

829
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:07,733
o nosso enginheiro de desenvolvimento
de programas no Google

830
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:11,333
para vir ao palco e dar para nós
um demo dessas ferramentas.

831
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,100
Chris Reimsdale.

832
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,567
[aplausos]

833
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:18,733
"Obrigado, Eric."

834
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:20,267
"Bem, se vamos fazer fácil"

835
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:24,200
"lançar, escalar, e dar apoio"
"ao seu web app no cloud,"

836
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,933
temos que fazer com que 
é fácil de desenvolver também.

837
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:26,633
Como eu já faleir

838
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:28,500
"nos últimos meses, temos trabalhado"
com VMWare

839
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,400
e Spring para juntar um bom conjunto
de ferramentas de desenvolvimento.

840
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,700
E uma dessas ferramentas de que falou
foi o SpringRoo.

841
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,067
Spring Roo é uma fantástica utilidade
de command line

842
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:41,633
para gerar e manter
muito do código repetido

843
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,300
para montar os applicativos da web.

844
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,867
E prestava muita atenção
ao back-end.

845
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:48,333
Agora com a intergração
com o Google Web Toolkit

846
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,267
o que pode agora fazer
é criar aplicativos da web maravilhosos

847
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:56,333
que estão construido com HTML5 e Ajax
para dar uma experiencia muito bom ao usuário

848
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,100
Agora para ver isso em ação

849
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,867
eu vou passar à utilidade 
"de command line, SpringRoo"

850
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:01,967
e tenho um monte de controles
disponíveis.

851
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,433
Mas a maneira mais fácil de começar
é usar uma das scripts

852
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,000
que enviamos junto com SpringRoo.

853
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,567
Vamos usar o exemplo de gastos
que temos aquí.

854
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,267
E o que vão ver é que o Spring Roo
gerou muito código para mim.

855
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:14,467
Está gerando o meu projeto.

856
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:15,867
Está gerando um persistence layer.

857
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:17,900
"Está gerando os aspectos, o controlador."

858
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,467
Está gerando um arquivo
para controlar todas as dependencias

859
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:23,100
E finalmente está gerando
o applicativo da web.

860
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,267
Aí está.

861
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:27,167
"E, no final,"
tenho um aplicativo.

862
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:27,933
"Tenho o front-end,"

863
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:29,200
o backp-end.

864
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
E posso rodar esse aplicativo
do command line

865
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,967
usando ferramentas da indústria
tais como o Maven.

866
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:34,100
É bem simples.

867
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,400
Mas para mostrar um pouquinho mais do demo

868
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,633
"vamos passar ao ID,"

869
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,500
"afinal, adoramos as ferramentas."

870
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,833
Então isso é o conjunto de ferramentas
do SpringSource.

871
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,667
O IDE de Spring.

872
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,033
"Está montado no Eclipse,"

873
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:46,633
e tem entradas de integração
com o plug-in de Google.

874
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:47,667
E podemos ver que

875
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:51,200
porque o aplicativo já está
instalado no IDE.

876
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,467
E aí está.

877
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:54,633
O aplicativo My Expenses.

878
00:44:54,633 --> 00:45:00,433
"Agora, para rodar, somente tenho que"
"apertar ""run as"""

879
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:02,533
"""web application"""

880
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,533
e o plug-in
do Eclipse vai asumir o controle.

881
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:06,533
E então vai começar a carregar
ums dos componentes no IDE.

882
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:08,100
E finalmente vai dar
um URL

883
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,767
que pode usar dentro do navegador
para carregar o aplicativo.

884
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,500
Vou ver isso aquí.

885
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,333

886
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:19,233
Vou fazer uma coisa aquí
antes de lançar.

887
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,300
Com o URL 

888
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,133
Eu posso fazer click e 
abrir com Firefox.

889
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:27,967
E agora ele vai
lançar Firefox

890
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:30,333
e vai rodar o meu aplicativo
"dentro do naveador,"

891
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,567
mas vai me dar a posibilidade
de depuração dentro de Eclipse.

892
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:34,467
"na verdade, é STS neste caso."

893
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:37,133
Agora tem muitos componentes 
lançados por este IDE

894
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:39,900
e se quer saber 
o que está acontecendo

895
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,300
passa pelas sessões mais tarde

896
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,133
e vamos explicar com muitos detalhes
o que está acontecendo.

897
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:43,633
É bem bacana.

898
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,000
"Tem algums componentes, algumas"
compilações processando.

899
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,433
Vamos deixar de falar nisso agora.

900
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:51,467
Queremos focalizar no fato de que
está rodando dentro de Firefox.

901
00:45:51,467 --> 00:45:52,133
E aí vai.

902
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:53,700
Podemos ver o aplicativo.

903
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,400
"É bem simples, "

904
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,300
mas tem todos os pedaços
de armação que preciso

905
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,567
para começar a criar
o meu aplicativo.

906
00:45:57,567 --> 00:45:58,567
"Tenho a informação,"

907
00:45:58,567 --> 00:45:59,900
"os empregados,"

908
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,700
os gastos.

909
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,033
Eu posso revisá-los

910
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,333
ou gerar outros novos.

911
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,133
Eu posso gerar um empregado novo.

912
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:08,633
Vamos dá-lo um nome.

913
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,500
Username é Pramsdale.

914
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,233
E um comentário

915
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:13,033
isso é um demo e não quero 
amanezá-lo

916
00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:14,100
"por isso faço click no ""cancel."""

917
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,333
E que vemos aquí
é que diz

918
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,767
"Olha, você tem um formulário."

919
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:17,900
O formulário tem dados.

920
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,400
Não está armanezado.

921
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,300
Tem certeza que quer sair?

922
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,767
Tudo isso é grátis.

923
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:24,133
E confirmação do formulário.

924
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,500
"Para repitir, é código repetitivo com que"
não tem que se preocupar.

925
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,700
"Eu disse, ""Tá"
"vou abandonar as alterações."""

926
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,333
E a outra coisa que veem
é  que apertei o back button

927
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,800
"Imediatamente, volto para o lugar"
onde estava. Certo?

928
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Não saí do app.

929
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,967
É a beleza de Ajax.

930
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:37,867
Tudo é transparente.

931
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:39,300
Acontece dentro do navegador.

932
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,000
Então a experiência do ponto
de vista do usuário é fantástico.

933
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,100
Mas agora que vimos o que 
podemos fazer com este app

934
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,033
vamos construir
e adaptar este app.

935
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:49,067
Vou voltar para o IDE.

936
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,767
"Tipicamente, o que voce quer fazer"
quando está desenvolvendo o seu app

937
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,433
vai começar com 
o seu data model.

938
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:57,367
O seu data model é onde está
armazenado todos os dados do applicativo.

939
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:57,800
OK

940
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,567
Essas mudanças são bem simples.

941
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,067
Neste caso vamos atualizar
o empregado.

942
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:03,900
Vamos colocar um número celular.

943
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,233
Aí está ele.

944
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:07,733

945
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:11,300
Agora chamamos esta class

946
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,000
Espera um segundo.

947
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,167

948
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,033
Vamos ir por aquí

949
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,433
e vamos dizer que
tem um display name

950
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:19,833
Tem um user name

951
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:22,533
Vamos colocar o celular para ele.

952
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:28,067

953
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:30,033
OK. Isso foi uma alteração
bem simples.

954
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,367
Somente acrescentei um field
para ums dos objetos de dados.

955
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:34,267
Mas o problema é que quando
muda o data model

956
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:36,000
tipicamente com aplicações grandes

957
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,600
tem muitas consequências.

958
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,867
Tenho que mudar meus views

959
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:40,167
os meus controladores.

960
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:43,433
Tenho que mudar o código
para transportar o objeto 

961
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:45,567
É código simples e repetido
que não quero ter que escrever.

962
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,267
Quero concentrar
nos features impressivos.

963
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,833
A coisa linda é que
"no instante que escolho ""save"""

964
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,467
"e armanezar isso dentro do navegador,"

965
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:53,933
o Roo vai tomar...

966
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:58,833
vai tomar essas alterações e
propagá-las por todo o aplicativo.

967
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:02,400
Vamos ver a ação
mais uma vez.

968
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,300

969
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,767
Tenho um erro na aplicação.

970
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:14,100
Descupla.

971
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Vou tentar mais uma vez.

972
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:22,333
Vou por aquí
vou criar...

973
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,800
...um private string...

974
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,167
...celular...

975
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:27,867
Aí está.

976
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:28,367
Descupla.

977
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,833
E agora você vai ver o Roo
tomar a alteração

978
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,133
e propagá-la 
pelo aplicativo

979
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:33,667
e mudar todas as fichas que mencionei.

980
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,033
É muito bom.

981
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:35,500
"Agora você vai pensar,"

982
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,133
OK. Gerou esse código para mim.

983
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:39,533
Mas agora eu tenho que
compilar de novo

984
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:40,600
E tenho que redeploy

985
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,533
Vai tomar ums minutos.

986
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:43,467
"E eu vou ler, você sabe,"

987
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,800
"um pouquinho do blog, "
e um pouquinho de twitter

988
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,600
Mas este não é o caso.

989
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,567
Porque somente tenho que 
voltar ao aplicativo

990
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:51,433
"fazer click no ""reload"""

991
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:55,767
Sim... tenho certeza que quero sair

992
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:56,933
E aí!

993
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,800
Vocês podem ver aquí
aí está a entrada de celular.

994
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,133
Tudo completo.

995
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:02,333
Somente tive que fazer uma
alteração e fazer click no save

996
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,033
Uma colaboração muito bom.

997
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:05,967
"Agora, o caso sutil, "
mas poderoso é que

998
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:08,300
mesmo que temos muitas 
ferramentas para usar

999
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,567
são mais ou menos 6 ou 7
juntos aquí

1000
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:12,367
e toos têm tecnologías específicas

1001
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,433
a coisa boa é que
no final do día

1002
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:17,433
geram uma aplicativo que
é construído a base de normas.

1003
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,167
Isto compila num WAR file.

1004
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,867
Si tiver conhecimento dos web apps
você sabe o que é um WAR file.

1005
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:24,633
E porque está montado com HTML5
Javascript e CSS

1006
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:27,533
posso lançar o aplicativo
onde quiser.

1007
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:29,767
"Posso lançá-lo em nosso cloud,"
Google App Engine.

1008
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:33,200
Posso lançá-lo em ambiente local
como o DMWearZ Fabric.

1009
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,967
Você pode lançâ-lo 
no cloud que quiser.

1010
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:37,000
A boa coisa é que
a escolha é sua.

1011
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,100
E é isso que pensamos
da portabilidade do cloud.

1012
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,867
e isso é o esforço nas ferramentas
de desenvolvimento que apoiamos.

1013
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:43,933
"E com isso,"
vamos voltar para o Eric.

1014
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:44,833

1015
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:51,667
[aplausos]

1016
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,400
"Eric: Muito obrigado, Chris."

1017
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,767
Obrigado.

1018
00:49:55,767 --> 00:50:03,167
É isso que temos da sessão 
de cloud computing.

1019
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,233
Se quiser saber mais
"do Google Web Toolkits,"

1020
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:07,667
"Srping Roo, e App Engine,"

1021
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:09,900
tem mais sessões
ao longo do día.

1022
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,733
Vou convidá-lhes para ver o agenda

1023
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:14,300
e assegurar que asistam a essas sessões.

1024
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,667
"E como tem visto, espero,"

1025
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,333
tem muita coisa estimulante

1026
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,933
tanto no front-end
"com navegadores e normas,"

1027
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,400
quanto no back-end
com servidores e App Engine.

1028
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:28,933
Mas umas das outras grandes dimensões
do estímulo na web hoje

1029
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,567
é o crecimento de mobile

1030
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:33,333
e o crecimento de aceso mobile
da internet.

1031
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,000
E quero convidar o Mario
para chegar ao palco

1032
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,200
para falar das informes mais recentes
do Android.

1033
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,300
Mario.

1034
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,800
[aplausos]

1035
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,567

1036
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:52,100
We're going to have to get Eric
a caipirinha

1037
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,833
a little fried mandioca for him later

1038
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:57,467
so he can taste some
Brazilian food

1039
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:59,167
and a Brazilian drink.

1040
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,467
"Well, let's talk about mobile."

1041
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:05,533
I had the opportunity to work

1042
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:08,833
on the Android team
for this last year and a half

1043
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,867
more or less

1044
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:10,967
at Google.

1045
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:14,600
And it was a really fascinating
experience to see the growth

1046
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,700
of this platform and of the mobile GSS 
platform and of the internet in general.

1047
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,833
I think that this question
"""Why mobile?"""

1048
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,400
two years ago was
more relevant.

1049
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,467
"Today I think that everyone already knows,"
"more or less, the answer"

1050
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,067
but it's worth talking
about...

1051
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:32,000
about some important facts.

1052
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,900
In order to...

1053
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,233
to help us understand a little
about the magnitude of opportunity

1054
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:43,200
"of the impact of this technology, let's look"
"at some numbers, some..."

1055
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,000
some data.

1056
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,500
"First, I think that "
everyone knows there are

1057
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,800
more or less 6.8 billion people
on the planet.

1058
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:57,400
But there are 4.1 billion
new mobile devices on the planet.

1059
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,667
A huge number.

1060
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:03,300
3/6 billion subscribers to mobile services.

1061
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,833
And 1.2 billion PCs.

1062
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,100
There are... 
almost...

1063
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,200
almost 3 and a half times 
more mobile devices than PCs.

1064
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,467
"This year, for the first time..."
in 2010

1065
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,467
for the first time [ ] year

1066
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,633
that more people are accessing the internet

1067
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:21,633
for the first time using a mobile device

1068
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:25,500
than using a desktop computer.

1069
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,767
Really an incredible thing.

1070
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:33,967
"And it's not only these numbers, but also"
a business opportunity

1071
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,067
we're going to go to 

1072
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:38,600
business opportunity 
is really very big.

1073
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,767
We can see here that

1074
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:44,433
the comparison of the size
of this opportunity

1075
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:48,500
with other businesses
that you might know.

1076
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,867
There's a big business opportunity.

1077
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,367
Now let's look at some other
interesting numbers here

1078
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:56,367
that's really cool.

1079
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:57,967
Let's compare

1080
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:02,400
we know that it's a gigantic market
and that it's growing very fast

1081
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,300
but the historical data are going to 
give a different perspective.

1082
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,500
"Let's look at AOL, which was  "

1083
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,167
for a lot of people

1084
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:12,500
mainly in the United States

1085
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,167
the first way
the first experience with the internet.

1086
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:22,667
This chart shows the growth
"in 5 years, in 20 quarters, of AOL."

1087
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:26,900
"During this period, AOL reached"
almost 20 million users

1088
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,533
a growth that at that time

1089
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:29,667
in the 90s

1090
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:32,867
we thought was
very fast growth.

1091
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:36,067
"In Japan, [ ] like "
iMode was for many

1092
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:40,300
also a very important experience 
for online access.

1093
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:45,100
It grew two times faster
"that AOL did,"

1094
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:52,833
reaching 40 million users more or less
during those 5 years.

1095
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,667
"Sure, lots of people remember"

1096
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:58,033
some of you may have been
a little young for this

1097
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:02,967
but a lot of people remember 
that in terms of a big explosion

1098
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:06,933
of internet use on the web
began with Netscape.

1099
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,100
And Netscape's base

1100
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,433
or Netscape

1101
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:12,000
it's user base reached a peak

1102
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,967
of more than 50 million users
in less than 5 years.

1103
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:20,067
So this growth was even faster

1104
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:23,600
Then came mobile web.

1105
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,733
And this is a very recent phenomenon.

1106
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:34,333
The iPhone and iPad made all of this from the 
past look like children's toys.

1107
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:37,033
"In four and a half years, the iPhone and iPad"

1108
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:41,833
together have reached
200 million users.

1109
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,100
And here's a ...
I think we know...

1110
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,667
everyone here has a cellphone

1111
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,633
and is accessing the web all the time

1112
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:53,667
but when we see these numbers
is when we really see this phenomenon.

1113
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:58,333
And the story of Android
is much more recent than that.

1114
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,633
But its growth is also
extraordinary and apparently sitll

1115
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:07,267
defines new standards of growth
in the technology industry.

1116
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:13,633
"In a short time, the Android"
has reached a growth almost...

1117
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:14,300
almost crazy.

1118
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,233
We have...

1119
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:18,400
We can see here
where Android is.

1120
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,733
"After 7 months, compared with "
"other technologies,"

1121
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:27,033
what we see is
 a really big growth.

1122
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:32,733
Now let's look at Android
in more specific terms.

1123
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:36,700
The mobility we use
is called activations.

1124
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,967
The number of new devices
that never used the network

1125
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:45,300
and that are appearing for the first
time on our servers.

1126
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,100
And these are only the devices 
that we see on our servers.

1127
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,233
They aren't implemenations of Android
in China or other places

1128
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:58,433
that aren't compatible and that 
don't use Google services.

1129
00:55:58,433 --> 00:56:02,700
We announced in February
in Barcelona

1130
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,800
that Android had reached
"60,000 activations each day."

1131
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,767
"From there, in May"

1132
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:09,500
at the Google IO conference

1133
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,867
the worldwide version
of our conference here

1134
00:56:12,867 --> 00:56:16,600
we announced that the number
"of activations had reached 100,000."

1135
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,933
"In June, it was up to 160,000."

1136
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:24,467
"And then, in August, we announced"
"it had passed 200,000."

1137
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:26,067
There are more...
today we're...

1138
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:30,867
there are more that 1-1/2 million
activations each week.

1139
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,433
Really a very big number.

1140
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:34,767
"In terms of applications,"

1141
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,900
we also see
this growth.

1142
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,500
"From 20,000 apps in February"

1143
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,433
"to 50,000 in May,"

1144
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,733
"60,000 in June,"
"70,000 in July,"

1145
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:48,200
And last Monday 
we announced

1146
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,800
that the number of Android apps

1147
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,433
"in the Android market surpassed 100,000."

1148
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:57,467
And the...

1149
00:56:57,467 --> 00:57:01,833
a we also see
the number of devices.

1150
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,733
There are 90 Android devices.

1151
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:06,800
Wehn we were thinking about
those growth curves

1152
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,000
it was exactly 2 years ago

1153
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,233
in October of 2008

1154
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:15,100
now it's October of 2010

1155
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,867
that the first Android device was launched
the G!

1156
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:25,233
"At that time, it was one device from"
one manufacturer from one country.

1157
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,000
In October of 2008.

1158
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,200
"Two years later, this is"
Android's situation.

1159
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,100
And so one thing I want to...

1160
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,567
one of the biggest reasons for
Android's growth 

1161
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:42,200
is the development
of apps for the platform.

1162
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,967
I want to thank all of the 
active developers in the Android market

1163
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:54,067
"that are here, I want to thank you"
for your contribution to this growth.

1164
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,767
"So after the numbers,"

1165
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,567
let's talk about some of the
latest news about Android.

1166
00:57:58,567 --> 00:58:02,133
Since we announced all of the
latest about Froyo

1167
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:03,967
"at Google IO, there was..."

1168
00:58:03,967 --> 00:58:06,500
we've been launching some new things.

1169
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,067
"For example, search suggestions"
on Android Market.

1170
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:11,500
If you do a search
on Android Market today

1171
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,433
it will be a little different
and better

1172
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:15,333
than a few months ago.

1173
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,900
You'll see suggestions
as you type.

1174
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,200
Our goal is to make a search
on Android Market

1175
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,467
as good as a search on Google

1176
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:29,133
that you're accustomed to.

1177
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,300
And...

1178
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,967
and when we talk about 
each app

1179
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:37,567
the developer's page
is a new feature.

1180
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:41,700
It allows user comments

1181
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,633
to be seen much more easily.

1182
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:47,900
And that page also has statements

1183
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,267
with the number of registered
problems for each app.

1184
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:54,600
And it shows details for each app

1185
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,533
to help you understand
 what's happening with the app.

1186
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:02,967
"Of course, users give permission"
to use this information

1187
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:06,000
and a lot of users give it.

1188
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,700
Now another important feature is

1189
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:16,967
server license verification

1190
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:18,800
This is a free service

1191
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,700
that allows developers like you
protect yourselves

1192
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,633
against piracy.

1193
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:27,033
It's a service that verifies
on the server

1194
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:29,933
that your apps being executed
were really licensed.

1195
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:31,667
This is a very important topic...

1196
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:35,000
so important that this afternoon
there's a special presentation

1197
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:45,267
about the licensing server
that you can see on the schedule.

1198
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:47,933
The next new feature
that we see on...

1199
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:52,367
that we launched in the
last few months is my favorite.

1200
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:54,000
It's cloud messaging:

1201
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,433
cloud to device messaging.

1202
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:59,500
It lets you send 
a message from your server

1203
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,333
or Google's server

1204
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:06,267
and then Google's server sends
a message to the Android device

1205
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:08,400
to execute some action.

1206
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,300
This is done with great efficiency
in real time at a very low cost.

1207
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,633
This is the same mechanism
used by Gmail.

1208
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:17,467
Before we launched this
to all the developers

1209
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:20,733
the same mechanism used
by Gmail to announce

1210
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:25,167
to inform the device
that new email has arrived.

1211
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:30,167
This is available for all
developers for free.

1212
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:33,900
And a very useful example of this
"is the ""Chrome-to-phone"" plug-in."

1213
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,400
I don't know how many of you have
"used the ""Chrome-to-phone"" plug-in"

1214
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,833
but it allows you to do something
on Google Chrome.

1215
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:42,467
For example...

1216
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:45,167
you can send
to your phone

1217
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:50,833
your cellphone number
or address and URL

1218
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,833
or a map you're looking for

1219
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:56,833
If I go from my house to the
World Trade Center in São Paulo

1220
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:01,367
I go from my house to Google's
office in Mountain View

1221
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,633
I look on my Mac

1222
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:05,233
on my home computer

1223
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:08,000
and because I'm logged in
on my Mac

1224
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,067
with the same account that 
I've logged in with on my Android

1225
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:14,767
I can use Chrome to phone.

1226
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:17,933
It send street informaiton

1227
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:19,800
which roads I take 

1228
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,033
to the phone.

1229
01:01:22,033 --> 01:01:22,533
On the phone

1230
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:28,067
the phone automatically launches
the Turn by Turn Navegation app

1231
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:31,533
that we'll see in just a bit here.

1232
01:01:31,533 --> 01:01:35,833
"So this is a very, very cool"
and innovative feature.

1233
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,233
And there's also

1234
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:42,967
we also included
a large number of new functions

1235
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:45,400
to improve corporate user's lives.

1236
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,267
Eric spoke a little about 
the importance

1237
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:53,767
of corporate users when he
talked about App Engine.

1238
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:58,400
And today we're not going into
details here

1239
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,900
but this latest information 
will help you

1240
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:04,233
"I hope, feel more confident in the"
IT teams

1241
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:09,767
and the IT users on the Android platform

1242
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,533
We're going to...

1243
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:15,000
I want to also talk about
what we recently announced.

1244
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,967
That's in the area of 
payments on Android.

1245
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:22,000
This is something we know: 
the monetization of apps

1246
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,933
is one of the big problems for
Android developers in the world.

1247
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:29,233
"Because of that, we've invested"
a lot into bringing

1248
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:35,000
the paid version of Android
to more and more countries.

1249
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,967
And we're pleased to announce
that the inroads into the  

1250
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:42,033
the paid Android market
has changed a lot.

1251
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:44,000
From this version we're seeing

1252
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,967
pay attention to the little maps

1253
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:49,400
For this version now.

1254
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:59,600
We've added 20 countries including
Brazil to the paying Android market.

1255
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,500
"I hope that it's good for you, too."

1256
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,667
And there's more to come.

1257
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:12,967
We have a clear roadmap
for payments on the Android market.

1258
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:16,500
And you should know 
that yesterday

1259
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,000
yesterday we announced
search by voice and

1260
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,500
navigation using Google maps
in Portuguese.

1261
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,467
I'd like to invite our Product Manager
here in Brazil to the stage.

1262
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:30,400
Marcelo Quintela.

1263
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,200
who participated a lot
in the development of these products

1264
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,233
to make a demo to show
this new feature.

1265
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,067
"Marcelo Qintela, please."

1266
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:42,100
[aplausos]

1267
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:42,733
Marcelo Quintela: Good.

1268
01:03:42,733 --> 01:03:44,633
Good morning.

1269
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:46,267
"Like Mario said,"

1270
01:03:46,267 --> 01:03:50,433
yesterday we announced 
two new features for Android.

1271
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:53,367
Whoever has had the chance to read

1272
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:55,833
our blogs or our news sites

1273
01:03:55,833 --> 01:04:01,767
they refer to the maps
and to search by voice.

1274
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:03,633
I first...

1275
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:06,433
I don't want to take too much 
of your time.

1276
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,867
I'm only going to show this feature.

1277
01:04:08,867 --> 01:04:16,300
"Actually, I invite you to use"
this feature yourselves.

1278
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,767
beause it's available beginning

1279
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:24,300
since yesterday on Android cells
1.6 and higher.

1280
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,733
"with version 4.5 of maps, the latest"
version you can get from Market

1281
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:31,267
It already has navegation.

1282
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:35,033
And with v. 2.1 and higher
you can get from Market

1283
01:04:35,033 --> 01:04:37,133
search by voice

1284
01:04:37,133 --> 01:04:39,967
download it and you can use it.

1285
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:41,900
It already exists in English

1286
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,900
Since yesterday
it's available in Portuguese.

1287
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:53,267
If you have a Froyo like this that was
launched simultaneously by Motorola

1288
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:57,100
"Froyo v. 2.2, it already comes with"
search by voice installed.

1289
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,567
So just to show you quickly
Maps that you...

1290
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,667
I imagine most of you already know;

1291
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:06,467
do a search for a point of interest
in the region

1292
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:09,400
You can find it
and if you used Maps

1293
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,667
you have already noticed that
you can get directions

1294
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:16,000
from where you are
to a certain place.

1295
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
you had three options

1296
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,267
But if you clicked on 
navegation by car

1297
01:05:19,267 --> 01:05:20,133
it didn't work.

1298
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,233
It wasn't available in Brazil.

1299
01:05:22,233 --> 01:05:23,900
As of now
if you click

1300
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,933
it'll give you point-to-point navegation.

1301
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:29,367
I'm not going to click here
because I don't have GPS

1302
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:31,533
and I'm not in a car.

1303
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:37,433
But I have a prepared route
to demonstrate the navegation.

1304
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,500

1305
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,567
Where's the volume?

1306
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:45,633
There are the same
the same features of Maps

1307
01:05:45,633 --> 01:05:48,167
that you know 
are here on the navegation.

1308
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:51,367
So you have the routes
that you know

1309
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:53,367
In São Pualo
you have traffic information.

1310
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,300
If you click this little button here

1311
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,233
you'll get to see an aerial view
of how 

1312
01:05:58,233 --> 01:06:02,833
of the state of the traffic
to your destination.

1313
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,533
If you...

1314
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:07,233
About a month ago
we launched Street View.

1315
01:06:07,233 --> 01:06:12,200
and so if you want to see
what's the way to your destination

1316
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,467
or the twists in the road

1317
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:18,833
you can call up Street View
and see what your route is.

1318
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,267
"That way, when you get "
to your destination.

1319
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:25,000
Instead of only telling you
"your destination is 400 meters ahead,"

1320
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,167
"your destination is on your right,"
you can...

1321
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:30,900
"you'll see a photo of your destination,"

1322
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,167
so you can see where
you're going.

1323
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:36,900
The same searches in Maps work.

1324
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,267
If you search for a drugstore

1325
01:06:38,267 --> 01:06:42,000
"for example, this search"
is optimized around this route

1326
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,767
and you can turn it
"the route, if you want."

1327
01:06:46,767 --> 01:06:52,800
And you'll see the drugstores
along the route.

1328
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,200
Good.

1329
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,000
So everything is available
in Street View

1330
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,400
"the satellite view, traffic"

1331
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,733
everything you recognize with Maps
now with routes in real time.

1332
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:06,267
with directions in Portuguese.

1333
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:08,733
"turn right, turn left"
"turn around, etc."

1334
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,800
This is a product that's not...

1335
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,733
directly associated
with development

1336
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:20,167
"on top of that, it also shows"
the investment

1337
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:22,067
that Google's making
in the Android platform.

1338
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:24,300

1339
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,533
And you can imagine someone

1340
01:07:26,533 --> 01:07:30,400
"at Christmas time, deciding between"
buying a cellphone

1341
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,833
a smartphone
or a GPS

1342
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:38,100
That person could choose to buy
two of these at the same time

1343
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,000
The other feature
now I'm going to ask

1344
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,200
"really, please, "
don't use the Internet

1345
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,200
or text from your cellphones

1346
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,433
because this really needs 
the Internet

1347
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:50,400
If it doesn't work

1348
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,200
you'll have to listen to me
tell a joke

1349
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,600
or something boring.

1350
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,000
Well.

1351
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,933
Starting now
when you install search by voice

1352
01:07:57,933 --> 01:08:00,600
or if you get a Froyo

1353
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,733
that already has it installed

1354
01:08:01,733 --> 01:08:04,367
in the Google search boxes you'll see

1355
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:06,500
there's this little microphone
at the side

1356
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,433
a lot like in the desktop demo
Eric made.

1357
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:15,133
If you now

1358
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:19,333
click on the microphone

1359
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,800
Photos of Ipanema

1360
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,300

1361
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,200
This is the end because I'm from Rio
I wanted to show off photos of my city

1362
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:32,533
I'm going to try something a little 
more complicated and ambitious

1363
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:37,467
How many people were there
at Bon Jovi's show?

1364
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:40,267

1365
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:42,400
"There is is: 65,000 people."

1366
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:50,933
[aplausos]

1367
01:08:50,933 --> 01:08:51,433
Good.

1368
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:54,133
And this feature is available 
in other apps.

1369
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:57,300
"It's available in Maps,"
on YouTube

1370
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,100
Any app with a little search box
now has a microphone there.

1371
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,333
We can...

1372
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:08,333
Ivete Sangalo at Madison Square Garden
in New York.

1373
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:12,200

1374
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,233
Ivete Sangalo.

1375
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,267
There it is
in New York

1376
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:16,700
Good.

1377
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,367
Let's watch a video so you can see.

1378
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:20,100

1379
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:23,067
What I wanted to show here
an app I grabbed off the inter...

1380
01:09:23,067 --> 01:09:27,333
from Market
from IMDB

1381
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:30,200
It's a third-party app  
that's not from Android.

1382
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,933
It's an app like you 
might have developed.

1383
01:09:32,933 --> 01:09:36,567
And it also has a search box.

1384
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:39,267
There's the little microphone.

1385
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:41,367
Tropa de Elite 2

1386
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:43,667

1387
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:44,767
And there's the result.

1388
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:49,400
So if you develop an application

1389
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:55,133
[API] or Speech Intent API
that has a search feature

1390
01:09:55,133 --> 01:09:58,233
It will be covered 
it's already available

1391
01:09:58,233 --> 01:10:01,467
But the interesting thing is that 
in a session this afternoon.

1392
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:04,433
Portuguese being understood
from now on you can count on

1393
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,167
Not only for the English-speaking public
in all of your applications.

1394
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:08,133
"but for the Brazilian-speaking public, too."

1395
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:09,633
You can use

1396
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:12,700
you can count on the little mike 

1397
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,800
to make your searches.
being available and you'll be able 

1398
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,333
"This, since it's been available"

1399
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:19,067
so any application 
since yesterday

1400
01:10:19,067 --> 01:10:23,167
that you launch starting today
that's on the market

1401
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:25,067
has that feature available.

1402
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,267
"Thanks, Mario."

1403
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:30,867

1404
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:33,833

1405
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,267
Good.

1406
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:37,433
Can you hear me?

1407
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:42,433
This version not only understands carioca
"but Brazilian portuguese, too."

1408
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:44,667
So you can

1409
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:46,700
you can use them

1410
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,133
If you

1411
01:10:48,133 --> 01:10:49,600
If you want

1412
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,267
If you want

1413
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:57,467
[applause]

1414
01:10:57,467 --> 01:11:01,833
If you'd like to
