00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:13,340
PAUL IRISH: Hi, and welcome back
to GDL Presents, wherein

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,800
we profile a developer, dive
into a little bit of their

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,770
code and theory behind the
process, and find out how

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,820
exactly they make the
really incredible

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,200
things that they do.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,770
Today we have with us
Hakim El Hattab.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,340
How's it going, Hakim?

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,790
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Hey, it's going
really good, thanks.

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,830
Thanks for having me.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,510
PAUL IRISH: So Hakim, you are an
interactive developer based

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,110
in New York.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,120
You're from Sweden.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,220
You've made a bunch of
really cool labs.

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,150
Originally you were a Flash
developer, is that correct?

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,145
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Right,
that's right.

18
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,870
I used to work at Fantasy
Interactive.

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,390
And worked on a lot of campaign
sites, like heavy on

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,220
animation for Nintendo, and
that sort of thing.

21
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,830
A site that links for a short
time, but has the craziest

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,740
things you can think of.

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,200
Tornadoes just thrown
across the screen,

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,100
and all that stuff.

25
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,400
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, you're kind of
you're one of this cadre of

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
Flash to JavaScript developers
that we saw, like, you, Mr.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,200
Dube, Seb Lee-Delisle,
Paul Lewis.

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,800
Like this amazing talent when
it comes to visuals and

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,770
interactive design, and all
of a sudden, being in the

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,200
JavaScript community, we saw
you and these other people

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,740
coming in and starting
to do these

32
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,300
really impressive things.

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,000
And we're just like,
wow, thank you.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, there's a lot to learn.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,180
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I think that's
really interesting.

36
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,610
Coming from a Flash background,
you have that

37
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,000
animation way of thinking,
like you think about

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,420
everything in motion.

39
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,190
And then just as JavaScript was
getting powerful enough to

40
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,170
actually replicate some of the
things, that's where it got

41
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,960
interesting for myself and
a lot of the other names

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,690
mentioned as well, I think.

43
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,886
When you could start producing
things that we already did in

44
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:52,040
Flash, we could do it as
good in JavaScript.

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,190
And that's been really
exciting.

46
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,200
And I think just from working
on so many sites with heavy

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,550
animations, you get into the

48
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,900
nitty-gritty of using equations.

49
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,020
And that right perfect sensation
in UI should feel

50
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,860
fast here, to these in and out,
or to do, I don't know,

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,070
you tweak numbers
indefinitely.

52
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,245
That didn't really exist
in the typical

53
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:14,280
HTML developer community.

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,210
And now it's starting to happen
more and more though,

55
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,790
people are coming in learning
JavaScript and animation at

56
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,725
the same time, just because
they're seeing a lot of good

57
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,140
examples of it.

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,320
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely I
think that, in your products

59
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,180
in particular, we've seen a lot
of detail when it comes to

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,550
the subtlety of interaction,
that many people hadn't

61
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,720
realized that is worthwhile
to spend time on.

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
But I've seen a lot of
your experiments.

63
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,660
So I'm actually going to-- let's
bring up one of your

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,370
experiments now.

65
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,290
Anyone can go visit these
at lab.hakim.se.

66
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,870
But there's some great
stuff in here.

67
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,500
More recently you've worked on
Avgrund and Meny, which are

68
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,890
pretty cool.

69
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,320
Do you want talk about these?

70
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,850
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
absolutely.

71
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,675
So let's start with the names
which I find funny myself.

72
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:01,370
I've gone for a full transition
into Swedish names

73
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,910
for everything I do.

74
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,160
So I am Swedish originally,
I'm born and raised there.

75
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,430
And Avgrund and Meny
are the two of the

76
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,880
first Swedish names.

77
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,100
Just kind of keep going,
kind of like Ikea.

78
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,340
That's my plan for it.

79
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,610
So Avgrund is a concept for--

80
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,260
well, I think Chris Coyier
expressed it the best way,

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,220
it's receding modal.

82
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,610
So it takes the typical pop-up
concept, but it also places

83
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,540
the page backwards in depth
and blurs is out, so you

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,650
really get that feeling of
content being de-emphasize and

85
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,790
pop-up being emphasized.

86
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,160
And here in Avgrund you're
using, I guess you're just

87
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,820
throwing a black background
around everything, you're

88
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,410
using a 2D transform to scale
the background, a CSS filter

89
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,100
for the blur.

90
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,110
Is that how you're
doing things?

91
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,880
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's exactly
it, you got it.

92
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,517
The filter blur is kind of slow,
so I've disabled it when

93
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,790
I've used it myself on
a couple of places.

94
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,150
But it adds a nice effect.

95
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,550
Still, it's just a heavy
operation to bl a

96
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,730
whole page like that.

97
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,280
PAUL IRISH: It's really cool.

98
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,640
And so Meny is a way to kind of
hide a menu but reveal it

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,970
in 3D space.

100
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,790
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
that started out as--

101
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,709
I had an idea for a really
cool concept.

102
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,970
I didn't really think it was
going to be very useful.

103
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,590
But then, after having
built it out and

104
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,920
seeing that it actually--

105
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,535
I mean it added some
value to the page.

106
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,230
Because you could hide a menu,
you could reveal it, without

107
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,140
losing all the contents
on the right side.

108
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,400
So it was a hidden menu that
still kept all the content

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,250
visible, even if you
expanded it.

110
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,740
A lot of other menus will expand
on top of the contents,

111
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,610
and you have to hide them to
see the content again.

112
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,370
Plus it just really
looks cool.

113
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,085
[INAUDIBLE].

114
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,880
PAUL IRISH: It totally
looks cool.

115
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,105
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah, this is
the latest version where you

116
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,985
can set it on any direction
as a page.

117
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,240
First off, it was just
a concept for

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,120
coming in from the left.

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,085
And then I revised it, and
open-sourced it, and packaged

120
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,390
it up nicely, so then
anyone could use it.

121
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,210
PAUL IRISH: That's
really nice.

122
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,450
Yeah, this is great.

123
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,460
I've actually--

124
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,460
we profiled Michael Deal earlier
on this program.

125
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,990
And he's already using both of
these experiments in his work.

126
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,330
So I'm seeing a lot of solid
adoption already for some of

127
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,560
these UI concepts.

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,470
What kind of inspires
you to explore

129
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,650
these interaction ideas?

130
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,630
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I think that's
what's always inspired

131
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,700
me to work in the field
that I work.

132
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,990
Just interfaces and interaction
has always been

133
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,530
what's exciting to me.

134
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,040
I studied digital animation,
which got me into the Flash

135
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,590
scene, and animation
in general.

136
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,100
Not even just interactively,
but video as well.

137
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,630
And then got into Flash,
and did some very

138
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,800
heavy lifting in animation.

139
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,170
But then, now lately, I'm mostly
interested in building

140
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,750
useful UI components.

141
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,950
Nothing extreme anymore, I
want to go more to useful

142
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,960
utility instead of cosmetics.

143
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,700
That's sort of where
I'm going.

144
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,850
PAUL IRISH: I want to bring up
an experiment right now, which

145
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,220
might fall into the cosmetics
side of things, perhaps.

146
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,570
This is stroll.js.

147
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,490
And so stroll is a small little
library that applies

148
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,920
effects to a list as you
scroll through it.

149
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,180
And so there's a number of
different 2D and 3D effects

150
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,690
that you can experience
as you're scrolling

151
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,630
through a big list.

152
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,230
HAKIM EL HATTAB: There's
been a lot of

153
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,370
contributions as well.

154
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,840
So I only started out with about
eight of them, and then

155
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
people start adding to
them like crazy.

156
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,470
So there's a bunch of different
styles on there now,

157
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,780
that I didn't think of myself.

158
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,980
But I built the framework for
it, I guess, and then it was

159
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,730
easy enough to add
other styles.

160
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,270
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, and this
was a fun project.

161
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,830
I noticed especially when it was
open sourced, I personally

162
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,670
got really excited.

163
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,146
I hopped in there, I started
viewing the source, and I was

164
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:10,850
like, I think we could maybe do
this a little bit faster.

165
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,250
And so actually, I'll bring up
now what I did when I saw it

166
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,310
the first time.

167
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,890
Which is, we had recently added
a feature to the Chrome

168
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:26,050
dev tools where you can
essentially get, more or less,

169
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,960
a rendering profile.

170
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,720
So I'll do that now.

171
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,460
So this is in Timeline
and Frames.

172
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,170
And I'll record a little
session, and

173
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,640
scroll a little bit.

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,810
And so what happens is, we're
able to capture a little area.

175
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,710
And then I'm going to narrow
that down, and we can zoom in

176
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,860
to basically see the length
of all the frames.

177
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,610
And in some of these cases, some
of these frames become

178
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,500
quite long.

179
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,040
So the target length of a frame
is 16 milliseconds.

180
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,370
But in some of these cases,
we have frames around 70

181
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,340
milliseconds.

182
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,900
And so sometimes with this tool,
you get a good idea of

183
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,900
exactly what's taking so long.

184
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,000
And in this case, there's a
recalculate style that takes a

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,020
full 20 milliseconds.

186
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,460
And we can click over to see
exactly what line in our

187
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,980
script caused the recalc style
to happen, and see.

188
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,750
So what I and a few other
developers did early on was

189
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,020
look at this and identify
where we

190
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,980
could optimize things.

191
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,660
Maybe we could avoid hitting
this particular line of code

192
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,060
on all loops and do it
more infrequently.

193
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,150
But there was, I think--

194
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,790
HAKIM EL HATTAB: And you pulled
it off really well.

195
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,250
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

196
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,520
Yeah, and I think lately there's
been a few more tools

197
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,060
recently to get the browser
side prospective of how

198
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,800
exactly things are
happening, right?

199
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,430
So from a developer tools side,
we can get a better idea

200
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,570
of how to improve this work.

201
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,900
Is there anything that--

202
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,700
is there any normal workflows
that you've gone through for

203
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,050
dealing with improving the
runtime performance of your

204
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,761
experiments?

205
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,700
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh
yeah, absolutely.

206
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,440
Not only my experiments, but
even my daytime work.

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,430
It's all about optimization.

208
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,050
Because now JavaScript and HTML
is being used for more

209
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,640
and more heavy production.

210
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,020
What used to be Flash, these
really heavy interactive

211
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,230
productions, animation
productions, and then when we

212
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,450
do that in HTML, we need the
tools to analyze it and

213
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,980
profile it.

214
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,990
And this is really starting
to pay off.

215
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,110
The tools set is incredibly
good, short of seeing it as my

216
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,010
future editor for code
as well, I can do

217
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,350
everything in there.

218
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,760
I've definitely been using
Timeline as well for some of

219
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,867
my projects, it's been
very helpful.

220
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,430
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

221
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,940
Awesome.

222
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,110
So we'll switch over--

223
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,685
HAKIM EL HATTAB: So it might be
worth mentioning though, on

224
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,720
the scroll effects there, that
was also remade into a mobile

225
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,840
experiment.

226
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,970
When Chrome Experiments opened
up for mobile submissions, I

227
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,540
rebuilt it, or did a
V2 on it, that does

228
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,940
support touch events.

229
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,910
And I had to build my own
momentum scrolling.

230
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,740
You know that kind of
feeling you get?

231
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,550
PAUL IRISH: Yeah

232
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,580
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Because
I couldn't use--

233
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,250
there's this overflow scroll
for mobile support,

234
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,030
specifically that does
momentum scrolling

235
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,000
automatically for you.

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,850
But I couldn't do that, because
you can't read the

237
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,720
positions of the list
items then while it

238
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,560
scrolls with momentum.

239
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,100
And so I wrote my own.

240
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,230
Anyway, you should
check that out.

241
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,120
It's pretty cool.

242
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,275
It looks cool in iPhone.

243
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:50,550
PAUL IRISH: Very cool.

244
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,590
And I think that is that at
mobile.chromeexperiments.com?

245
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,670
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
that should be it.

246
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,250
Actually, if you just hit
chromeexperiments.com on your

247
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,090
phone, you'll get there.

248
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,340
PAUL IRISH: Ah, true, true.

249
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,500

250
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,590
Yeah, there's a lot of really
powerful experiments there

251
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,800
that are optimized for
the touch experience.

252
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,730
A lot of good stuff.

253
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:15,990
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That was an

254
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,190
interesting performance change.

255
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,130
PAUL IRISH: An interesting
performance

256
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,550
change, right, yeah.

257
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:28,700
Dealing with slower hardware,
less memory, a bit of it is

258
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,590
trial and error to find out how
far you can push things.

259
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,390
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Right, at the
time I didn't have a good

260
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,560
profiling tool for mobile.

261
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,910
That's starting to get
better as well,

262
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,580
definitely very helpful.

263
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,940
But it was sort of
like a black box.

264
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,770
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

265
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,430
Do you use debugging tools
for mobile now?

266
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,910
Or what's your workflow there?

267
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,200
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I just started
using the-- because

268
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,600
they come built in now
to Safari 6.0.

269
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,880
And it's really, really fast.

270
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,190
I've started using that for
the mobile work that I do.

271
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,760
And it's been helpful.

272
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,870
PAUL IRISH: I've personally
experimented with the Safari 6

273
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,300
remote debugging, the Chrome on
Android remote debugging,

274
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,590
and also Adobe Shadow.

275
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,180
It doesn't have all the
capabilities of your typical

276
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,980
web kit inspector, but
it's very convenient.

277
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,350
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I tried
Adobe Shadow as well.

278
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,080
I guess my only complaint there
was the response time is

279
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,650
little bit slow.

280
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,040
Just communication in between.

281
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,130
Maybe it was my set up.

282
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:29,750
I don't know.

283
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,370
It felt a lot slower.

284
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,120
PAUL IRISH: OK, cool.

285
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,020
I wanted to shift over to a
project that I think a lot of

286
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,140
people have seen.

287
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,570
And that is reveal.js.

288
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,460
So reveal.js is a
slide framework.

289
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,220
HAKIM EL HATTAB: It's a HTML
presentation framework.

290
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,010
PAUL IRISH: I like it.

291
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,970
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's what
I usually call it.

292
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,700
It's just a presentation
framework built on top of HTML

293
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,680
and using your browser to
create fully fledged

294
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,920
presentations that
you'd typically

295
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,830
create in desktop software.

296
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,820
It's pretty popular space
for HTML right now.

297
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,480
There's a lot of similar
frameworks.

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,970
I guess, over time reveal.js has
differentiated itself as a

299
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,720
really feature-rich framework.

300
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,350
It's just happened over time.

301
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,930
We've added many more features
since the original so simple.

302
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,340
But now it has Markdown support,
it has PDF exports,

303
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,710
and themes, and transitions
styles.

304
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,790
You name it, a lot of
things in there.

305
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,410
PAUL IRISH: It's very nice.

306
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,520
Yeah, I've used it a lot.

307
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,390
And actually we had an internal
conference inside

308
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,790
Google a bit ago.

309
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,300
And one of the engineers who
works on Chrome's rendering

310
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,960
path took a look.

311
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,800
We were both sharing a

312
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,220
presentation, and using reveal.js.

313
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,140
And so he actually dove into
some of the techniques that

314
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,960
were being used for reveal.js
and found a few

315
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,380
insufficiencies where you
could actually eek out

316
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,940
slightly better performance.

317
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,230
And I think one of them
was my fault.

318
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,620
I was applying a z-index to
some of the headlines.

319
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,340
And when you apply a z-index, it
actually bumps that render

320
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,860
layer out of the rest
of the render layer.

321
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,230
So let's say we have a slide
and we're transitioning it

322
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,760
with the transform, having a
z-index on one of the elements

323
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,940
inside that, brings it to
another thing, and so that has

324
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,780
to be made manipulated
separately.

325
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,700
And so we were getting overall
a slower FPS number.

326
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,250
And so--

327
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,910
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's really
interesting because I use 3D

328
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,675
transforms inside of the slides
as well for these hover

329
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,920
effects on my links.

330
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,130
They do a 3D roll, which
I thought looked nice.

331
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,630
But that must suffer from
the same performance

332
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,230
limitations then so.

333
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,960
PAUL IRISH: Probably,
yeah, yeah.

334
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,240
And generally you want to
bring down the number of

335
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,045
render layers that you're
manipulating at the same time,

336
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,630
and keep that to a minimum.

337
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,010
But that was a small
optimization that we found.

338
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,410
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I guess the
page gets caught or painted as

339
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,280
a bitmap as soon as it goes
in through GPU in 3D

340
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,490
transforming.

341
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,125
So if you don't have to redraw
that bit map while it's in

342
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,390
perspective, I assume it's
going to be a lot faster.

343
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,710

344
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,860
PAUL IRISH: So yeah, reveal.js
has been great.

345
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,570
And I particularly like editing
my slides in HTML,

346
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,690
bringing it out, and having
a great interface on it.

347
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,380
And I know a lot of other
people, including Brendan

348
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,930
Eich, creator of JavaScript,
he's used it as framework.

349
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,180
It's pretty rad.

350
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,730
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah, that
was pretty amazing.

351
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,330
I was really happy
to see that.

352
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,360
I also watched, what was
that, it was Lisbon JS

353
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,620
conference last week.

354
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,600
And some crazy number of people
were using reveal.js,

355
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,240
like seven or so.

356
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,280
It was a lot of fun.

357
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,340
That's really rewarding.

358
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,230
I think that inspires
me to keep going.

359
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,190
Otherwise most my projects are
fairly short lived right now.

360
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,740
Wrap them up, and placed
them on GitHub and not

361
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,970
touched them again.

362
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,560
But with reveal.js I'm
definitely continuing on

363
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,420
developing and improving
on long term.

364
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,560
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, and so
you've actually kind of

365
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,740
evolved the reveal.js scene more
recently with the release

366
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,500
of rvl.io, I guess you would
pronounce it that way.

367
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,490
Pronunciation doesn't really
exist in the internet.

368
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,610
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I tried to get
reveal.io actually spelled

369
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,350
out, but somebody
else took it.

370
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,950
PAUL IRISH: OK, cool.

371
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,480
Do you want to talk about what
the idea behind rvl.io is?

372
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,370

373
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,120
That worked out.

[SIDE CONVERSATION]

375
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,960
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, the
break was perfect.

00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,780
Hey, what's up.

377
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,329
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh, that
was a big break.

PAUL IRISH: You look stark.

380
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,079
Sir, you are stuck
in molasses.

381
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,329
Not rad.

382
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,760

383
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,140
I am the internet, I am
opposed to this word.

384
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,440
I will break for you.

385
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,550
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That was
a very big break.

386
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,310
Can you hear me now?

387
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,390
PAUL IRISH: Yes, can
hear you good now.

388
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,020
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Doing good,
my connection not so much.

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,500

he's dropped.

PAUL IRISH: Can I shoot like 20
seconds of each just when

00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,010
we're done with Hakim, and then
you just throw it on?

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,340
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh,
I'm back now.

396
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,930
Wow, and my quality
is good now too.

397
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,490
That's weird.

[SIDE CONVERSATION]

399
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,370
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, of all the
things that we've gone

400
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,440
through, those particular demos
would be easy to kind of

401
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
merge in later.

402
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,160
There's a lot of sections we
are talking for awhile.

403
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,140
And it would just like--

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:33,185
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

405
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:35,270
PAUL IRISH: Our conversation
wasn't very specific about

406
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,340
what was happening on screen.

407
00:19:36,340 --> 00:20:05,840
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

408
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,800
PAUL IRISH: Great.

409
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,840
HAKIM EL HATTAB: So we're
starting with rvl.io.

410
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,090
PAUL IRISH: Yep.

411
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,880

412
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:23,290
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

413
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,032
PAUL IRISH: So Hakim, tell me
a little bit about rvl.io.

414
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:30,850
HAKIM EL HATTAB: So rvl.io is
the HTML or the online editing

415
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,370
suite for reveal.js.

416
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,580
Where you don't have to write
plain HTML, which is what

417
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,260
reveal.js is.

418
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,110
Instead, you can come in and
you can write it in WYSIWYG

419
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,680
editor, you see the--

420
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,240

421
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,495
well, you see what you're
going to get exactly.

422
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:52,020
I'm to build out a bit of, not
a community around it, but a

423
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,420
hosting for your
presentations.

424
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,940
So you don't even need to
download them to present them

425
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,990
elsewhere, you can keep
them online and

426
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,790
present then on the server.

427
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,370
And it was launched three
weeks ago now,

428
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,690
three or four weeks.

429
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,270
It's been under development
for a while though, at

430
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,540
collaboration, actually, with
a friend Hashad from India.

431
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,010
He's doing the service
side work.

432
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,210
And it's gained a pretty good
number of users so far.

433
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,850
It's been like 3,000,
3,500 users in the

434
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,190
first couple of weeks.

435
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,020
Most people are just playing
around with it though.

436
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,950
But I think there's a definite
audience for it.

437
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,490
I've seen a lot of good things
coming out as well.

438
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,990
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

439
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,510
I mean, it's really nice.

440
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:41,880
And it kind of collects a few of
your different experiments.

441
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,500
The Avgrund I saw just
a moment ago.

442
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,940
There's Reveal, and
there's a lot of

443
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,440
other really nice additions.

444
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,070
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah, I'm
trying to use my own stuff.

445
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,890
Wherever I can, just to--

446
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,430
if I end up using something
or one of my previously

447
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,192
experiments, then it feels
like I've done

448
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:03,750
something right I guess.

449
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,620
That's sort of the thinking.

450
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,770
Yeah, so you can save
your presentation.

451
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,430
You publish the presentation, it
will land on the home page.

452
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,670
And popular presentations
will group up there.

453
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,990
Basically level of editing,
but still very much in

454
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,490
development.

455
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,260
This is another project that I
expect to be working on for a

456
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,210
longer time.

457
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,490
Not just something I put out
there and am done with.

458
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,830

459
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,120
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it's
really nice.

460
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,100
So I don't have an
ability to--

461
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,240
so I know that I can author
and Markdown for reveal.js

462
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,090
Rvl.io I guess, because we have
WYSIWYG we don't really

463
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,790
need to edit in Markdown.

464
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,315
HAKIM EL HATTAB: No, I guess
that's the thinking around it,

465
00:22:45,315 --> 00:22:46,180
you wouldn't need it.

466
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,750
But there are some really
important core features which

467
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,200
aren't in it yet.

468
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,820
But I really believe in
releasing it early, putting it

469
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,470
in front of people and seeing
what they do with it, and then

470
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,240
listening to feedback instead of
trying to solve every case

471
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,490
before release it, I guess.

472
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,130
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

473
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,520
OK, question, this view right
here, where I can view my

474
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
presentations, we have
essentially this thumbnail.

475
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,210
How are we making this here?

476
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:11,660
HAKIM EL HATTAB:
The thumbnail?

477
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,030
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

478
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,140
HAKIM EL HATTAB: The thumbnail
is a minified version of the

479
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,750
presentation.

480
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,150
It's just the presentation
itself.

481
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,080
The same markup, same
styles, everything.

482
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,440
And then a scale is applied
to make it tiny.

483
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,240
It's kind of like a
ghetto thumbnail.

484
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,310
PAUL IRISH: 2D transform
scale?

485
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,620
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
that's it.

486
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,830
It actually has a little bit of
additional markup in there,

487
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,040
because it doesn't just the
first slide, it has the other

488
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,780
slides as well.

489
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,280
Some optimization to be done.

490
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,530
But it's an easy way to do a
thumbnail instead of having to

491
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,520
do image processing
on the server and

492
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,392
storing all of that.

493
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:48,990
It makes the server side work
a little bit more likely.

494
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,670
Which I'm always for.

495
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,650
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely.

496
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,630
Great.

497
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,860
And so the last thing I wanted
to talk about, real quick, is

498
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,560
this wonderful project that you
worked on while you were

499
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,610
at Fantasy Interactive.

500
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,860
And this is the 20 Things
I Learned About The Web.

501
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,020

502
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,050
e-book.

503
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,580
It's a book on the web.

504
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,600
But it's like the most book
on the web book there is.

505
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,090
So the experience is very
similar to a real book.

506
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,150
And there's a lot of techniques
in here that people

507
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,130
haven't really seen, especially

508
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,330
outside of Flash before.

509
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,820
So you want to talk a little bit
about how you built this?

510
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,470
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Sure, I think
this came out early 2011.

511
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,415
And I was working out of FI, so
we collaborated with Google

512
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:37,260
and the Chrome team.

513
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,000
The techniques about--
there's a lot of--

514
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,370
we tried to use everything we
could that was kind of leading

515
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,950
edge at the time.

516
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,450
So we're using, for
instance, local

517
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,560
storage to keep a bookmark.

518
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,690
If you go back to the book after
having visited it once,

519
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,490
and just dropped out at a page,
it will bring you back

520
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,190
into that page again.

521
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,390
We're using offline or cache,
application cache.

522
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,530
Since it's a very large book,
there's many illustrations in

523
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,150
there, it gets pretty
heavy in kilobytes.

524
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,650
So there's a cache manifest,
which stores all that on your

525
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,410
computer for the next time.

526
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,850
And we are using HTML5
History API.

527
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,512
So every page has a unique
URL, and you

528
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:21,700
can link into that.

529
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,230
The book has been translated
into a bunch of

530
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,640
languages as well.

531
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,950
I guess the most interesting
part, one thing that everybody

532
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,120
asks about is the page flip.

533
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,460
So the page flip is one very big
canvas element on top of

534
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,750
the whole book.

535
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,720
And then that in conjunction
with taking the page, which is

536
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,080
on the right side, and just
shrinking it downwards.

537
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,760
By having the overflow
be hidden, it makes

538
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,310
it look like a mask.

539
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,460
It's basically a magic trick.

540
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,650
The page underneath does just
get covered but the paper

541
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,860
that's coming up on top.

542
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,130
It gets covered, otherwise it
would be a hard cut where the

543
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,240
page is actually being masked.

544
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,110
Instead there's a layer on
top with paper which

545
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,770
makes it look nice.

546
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,380
You pull it over there, and then
there's a lot of shading.

547
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,640
I spent a good amount of time
figuring out the shadows, and

548
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,325
the highlights, and the
paper, and all that to

549
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,950
get that just right.

550
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,465
And we also--

551
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:21,520
I wrote an article about
that it as well.

552
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,880
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so people
can check this out.

553
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,870
This is on HTML5 rocks.

554
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,000
So if you just look for HTML5
Rocks Page Flip, you should be

555
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,980
able to read this great article
by Hakim, all about

556
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,350
this particular effect, the
markup, the theory, the

557
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,390
science, the math behind it.

558
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,060
And you know, steal the code and
use it on your own site.

559
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,930
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh yeah,
definitely steal it.

560
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,306
Steal everything I do.

561
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:51,240
PAUL IRISH: I like that.

562
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,490
I like it.

563
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,550

564
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,030
Cool.

565
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,040
Yeah, where do you use--

566
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,291
I mean there's a lot of
techniques in this 20 Things I

567
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:04,200
Learned project, and that
was a while ago.

568
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,610
And you always are staying up to
date with what's available

569
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,770
and browsers.

570
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,670
How do you manage to keeping
track of what's available and

571
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,043
the best way to do things?

572
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:17,330
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's
a good question.

573
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,280
I think most of it is I get
really snowed into one

574
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,740
specific feature that I get
super excited about, and I try

575
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,950
to master it.

576
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,990
So for very long period
of time that

577
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,010
was canvas, 2D canvas.

578
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,220
Just drawing all kinds
of animations.

579
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,980
And then recently it's been CSS,
and CSS transports and

580
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,640
transitions, in particular.

581
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
I've been using a lot.

582
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,960
I think I stay up to date with
it by seeing something that

583
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,920
excites me, and then just using
100 times over to see

584
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,740
what I can pull of with it.

585
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,085
And then in the end it ends up
being a loop of inspiration, I

586
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:53,710
guess, because you create
something that inspires

587
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,810
something else.

588
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,560
A good example is what you're
looking at now.

589
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,210
I had no idea what I was doing
when I started this.

590
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,200

591
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,880
This is a good example because
it is one of those cases where

592
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,470
I sat down and I placed a bunch
of dots on the screen.

593
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,270
And then, by doing that, I
started getting inspired into

594
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,590
connecting lights in between the
dots and moving the dots

595
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,870
around physically in a
relationship to each other.

596
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,090
And you start getting visual
effect that's pleasing.

597
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,110
And that's sort of where I land
on something like this.

598
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,810
It's not much planning,
it's mostly duration.

599
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,536
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
it's very cool.

600
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:37,520
I especially like--

601
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,160
I mean we saw this a little bit
with Bret Victor getting

602
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,620
immediate feedback ideas.

603
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,260
But there's a lot, especially
inside of the creative JS

604
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,520
realm where you can just start
with an idea and just

605
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,800
experiment until you find
the visual you like, the

606
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,520
interaction style you like.

607
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,850
There's a lot of flexibility
there that you normally don't

608
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,750
have in other parts of front-end
development.

609
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,060
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's true.

610
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,660
It's also about doing it as a
personal experiment, which

611
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,410
means there's no pressure on
you doing a specific thing.

612
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,980
I think the scary part is having
a specific picture in

613
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,820
mind, and trying to achieve
that exact thing.

614
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,540
Because then you limit yourself
from actually--

615
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,990
I don't know, it's more natural
to come up with the

616
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,680
thing you're doing.

617
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,460
It has to do with, you can never
have a complete picture

618
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,675
and just execute on that idea.

619
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,570
You have to be adaptive
throughout.

620
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,000
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely.

621
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Well there's a lot more
experiments that we could go

622
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,130
through that you've done that,
that are just totally change

623
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,970
at how people look at
experiencing the

624
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,330
front end of the web.

625
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,140
But I guess we'll
cut it there.

626
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,040
Hakim, thank you very
much for joining us.

627
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,540
This has been fantastic
to dive into

628
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,790
some of these products.

629
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,520

630
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,560
And thank you.

631
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,490
People can check you out, your
blog and some of your

632
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,740
experiments at hakim.se.

633
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,840

634
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,810
You're over on Twitter,
@hakimel.

635
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,260
I think, GitHub,
too, @hakimel.

636
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,770
Correct?

637
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,080
HAKIM EL HATTAB:
Yep, that's it.

638
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,900
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

639
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,557
And definitely take
a poke around some

640
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,700
of all these projects.

641
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,250
View source pretty much all
of them are on GitHub.

642
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:20,090
People can go fork them, make
tweaks, and then certainly

643
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,520
make use of some of them
in any upcoming

644
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,660
products, and stuff.

645
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,080
So thanks again, thank you.
