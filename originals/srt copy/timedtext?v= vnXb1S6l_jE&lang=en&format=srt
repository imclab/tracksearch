Hello my name is Adam. In this video I ‘ll
show you how to get your app uploaded in the

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,339
web store.
Until the store launches, developers will

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,959
need to use the Chrome Extension gallery’s
upload flow and developer dashboard to upload

4
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:18,330
and manage their apps. So, to get your app
in the store, go to the Chrome extensions

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,330
gallery at chrome.google.com/extensions and
click on the “Publish your extensions”

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,960
link on the left.
This will take you to our developer dashboard.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,050
Click “Add new item” to upload a new app.
You’ll then be asked to select the zip file

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:45,050
that contains your app manifest. Select the
file you have created, click "Upload" and

9
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,050
you’ll be taken to a page where you will
need to provide some additional information

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,789
about your app.
For those of you who have developed extensions,

11
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:00,059
you will recognize a lot of the fields you
need to complete, such as uploading screenshots,

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,740
selecting the primary language for your app,
providing a detailed descriptions well as

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,610
including links to your website and support
materials. However, we have added a few more

14
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,270
items on this page.
First of all you can select the price of your

15
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,390
app - by default this is set as free but you
can change it if you want to. To do so, click

16
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,390
on the “Change pricing” button. This will
bring up a panel that lets you select between

17
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,159
3 pricing options: an option to keep your
app free,  an option to use the Chrome Web

18
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,170
Store’s built in payment mechanism and finally
the option to use a different payment system

19
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,100
within your app.
The first option is intended for applications

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,329
that never charge any money, apps that are
free from end-to-end.

21
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,149
The second option, using the Chrome Web Store’s
payment mechanism, allows users to pay for

22
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,079
your app directly within the Web Store. Using
our licensing API you’ll then be able to

23
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,719
determine whether a given Chrome user who’s
entering your app has paid or not. If you

24
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,549
select this option, you will be asked to define
the price for your app from a set number of

25
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,090
price points. If you’re setting up a subscription-based
service, you can select whether to charge

26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,450
users per month or per year.
In addition, you can specify whether users

27
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,380
can try a free version of the app - we call
this option “free trial”. With this option,

28
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,780
users can instantly start using the free version
of your app. We encourage you to integrate

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,410
free trials because users are often more willing
to spend money for an app after trying it

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,020
out.
The third option is intended for apps that

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,150
use a custom payment solution. If you’ve
integrated another payment provider, select

32
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,520
this option. Also select this option if the
basic version of your app is free but users

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,220
can pay for upgrades, virtual goods or other
services later.

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,300
In addition to the pricing options, you’ll
also be asked to select up to 3 app categories

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,760
under which your app should be listed in the
store. To ensure good user ratings for your

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,260
apps make sure to include your app only in
relevant categories. This list will likely

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,920
be updated before our launch, so feel free
to suggest additional categories for your

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,810
app in the free form text box.
Further down, is one more important section

39
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,450
for apps: We require that you verify the ownership
of the website that your app is hosted on

40
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,570
using Google’s Webmaster Tools. You will
see the list of verified websites that are

41
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,730
associated with your account in the dropdown.
To verify additional websites, click the link

42
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,980
and follow the instructions for Google Webmaster
Tools.

43
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,160
We have a lot more material on different elements
on the upload flow in our documentation located

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,050
at code.google.com/chrome/webstore. We are
looking forward to seeing your apps in the

45
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,300
store!
