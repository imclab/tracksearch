1
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,667
DiBona: So...we're here
doing an interview.

2
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:10,834
Liu: We are.

3
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:14,734
We are here to get
nuggets of insight

4
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,000
from Chris DiBona.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,033
DiBona: Little chunklets.
Liu: Just little ones.

6
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,133
Because we can't handle
anything more.

7
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,167
But first we have to ask
about the Chrome comic.

8
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,701
>> DiBona: I should point out

9
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,634
when I heard they were doing
comic, I was like...really?

10
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,434
A comic?
Are you sure?

11
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,601
They were like, yeah.
I was like, okay.

12
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,334
And he, uh, made my goatee
very smooth, you know?

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,434
Liu: It's very, uh...

14
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:36,701
DiBona: Sweet...
Liu: Yeah.

15
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,067
DiBona:
That the internet it.

16
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,601
There were a lot of great
parodies, actually,

17
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,033
of that Chrome comics.

18
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:45,634
>> Liu: So how's--the feedback's
been very positive from Chrome.

19
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,934
DiBona: I think people seem
to like it, yeah.

20
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,868
There's been already a couple
of really interesting products

21
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,367
that have taken the Chrome code

22
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,467
and done different things
with it

23
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,334
which I thought
was really very positive.

24
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,334
There's already a ton of people
out there patching.

25
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,868
sending patches in to Chrome
to fix things.

26
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:02,000
In fact, we think
there's more patchers now

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,400
than there are employees.

28
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,501
Of course, they don't have
the same kind of output.

29
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:06,968
I mean, we're just talking
individual bug fixes,

30
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,267
but it's pretty impressive
that, you know,

31
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,501
we're able to look at that many
people that fast.

32
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:12,701
Liu: Yeah, so...

33
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,901
DiBona: I mean, not all patches

34
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,501
are appropriate for us
to accept but, yeah.

35
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,200
Liu: So obviously this was
a very, you know,

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,701
secretive project for a while,

37
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,467
and then you kinda like
just put it out there.

38
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,000
So again, companies
get flack sometimes

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,100
for like throwing code
over the wall...

40
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,200
DiBona: Sure, sure.
So it's funny, you know.

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,300
We actually have these
great internal debates

42
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,000
about when it's okay
to release some source code.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,701
Is it okay to just release it
and forget about?

44
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,133
Is it okay to release it and not
have a big deal around it?

45
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:40,167
Or should they all be heavy,
you know, sorta lots of people

46
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,767
working on building a community
and all the rest?

47
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:45,367
I think the answer is you should
do all of those things, right?

48
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,701
If you look at most
open source projects,

49
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:51,501
99% of them
is one person working on

50
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,801
a code base in the public,
and they get no help.

51
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,801
They get no bug fixes.
They barely get the users.

52
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,601
And then you have
small sets of those,

53
00:01:58,601 --> 00:01:59,801
they try a couple
of extra developers,

54
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,367
couple extra bug fixers.

55
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,434
And thus, a community, right?

56
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:05,000
And then you have others
that are,

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,100
frankly,
incredibly unusual

58
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,234
like Linux Chrome,
like Samba, like Mozilla...

59
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:14,601
which are incredibly large,
with thousands of developers,

60
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,334
thousands of people
working on them.

61
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,501
And those are not the norm.

62
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,968
Liu: What was the choice--

63
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,067
like what went into
the decision to...

64
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:24,167
hey, we're gonna make
this browser.

65
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:27,167
Why don't we just open up
a project on code

66
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:30,167
and then develop
a new open for the entire way?

67
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,234
DiBona: So with Chrome,
you know, ask Glen,

68
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,501
as he can probably
answer it best.

69
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,534
But there are times
when they release projects

70
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:40,634
that are, um...you know...

71
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,334
you know,
being developed in-house

72
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:45,868
in a very focused manner,
you know, for years,

73
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,434
you know, in the case of
Chrome and Android both.

74
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,868
I think they're both more than
two years old, those efforts.

75
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,868
And so, you know,

76
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,067
they want to basically
to tie performance,

77
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,334
tie performance reviews,
tie employees to the product.

78
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:00,801
And...and that's not...

79
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:04,100
something that's incompatible

80
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,801
with open sourcing,
by any measure.

81
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,300
But there is a level of...

82
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,834
"we just wanna do this work
ourselves for a while" goin' on.

83
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,834
We're actually--
we're not really under control.

84
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,634
Control takes a lot of work.
Man: Right.

85
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:18,434
I firmly believe the only way
to establish control

86
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:21,534
in open source is not through
the use of restrictive licensing

87
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,434
and not through any sort of
tricks around that.

88
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:27,200
I firmly believe
that the way you have control

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,334
and the way you have leadership
in open source

90
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,367
is by showing intelligent

91
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,701
technical leadership
on a project.

92
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:38,334
So as long as the Chrome team
at Google, you know,

93
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,167
makes the right decisions
technically for the product,

94
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,167
they're gonna be
in charge of Chrome

95
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,634
and Chromium, right?

96
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,634
Chromium meaning
the open source...

97
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,000
Man: Open source.

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,033
DiBona:...version of Chrome
that Chrome is built from.

99
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:51,701
So...with that said,

100
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:56,300
if people decide that Google
isn't giving that leadership,

101
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,434
then they will fork and
they'll create something else.

102
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:00,467
You know, probably call it
Technicium or something.

103
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,834
Whatever, you know?

104
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,033
Come up with something
I want to name it after.

105
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:06,000
And, um, the thing is
that's okay.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,467
That's a healthy thing.

107
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,767
That's something we wanna
actually encourage as a company

108
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,167
so when we release things
like Chrome,

109
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,601
we're doing it to make
the internet better.

110
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,567
We're not doing it to build
market share for Google.

111
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,868
We're doing it to make the
internet a free and fair place,

112
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:19,634
a place that can really
exist in a world

113
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,734
where people are used to
responsiveness and functionality

114
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,400
in desktop applications.

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,167
So...if people
take our technology

116
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,901
and advance that strategy,
great.

117
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,868
We're very happy.
Same with Android, you know?

118
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:33,334
It's like, you know, if people
don't like Android

119
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,467
and they wanna change it

120
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,434
and make it better
for their customers,

121
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:39,234
well, that's good for the idea
of a free and fair

122
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,667
and open cellular phone
operating system

123
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,734
and cellular phone
marketplace as well.

124
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:45,434
Which is good for Google,
right?

125
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,300
So we feel that we compete
quite well

126
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,400
in free and fair markets
like the internet

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,133
and like free and open
cell phones.

128
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,501
So that's why we're releasing
this technology.

129
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,067
So if somebody says
that they can do that

130
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,067
even better than we can...
that serves us.

131
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,601
It does well in my eyes.

132
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,167
So we try to encourage anyone.

133
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,667
But, yes, there's some things

134
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:06,067
we strategically decided
not to release.

135
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,567
GFS is one of them.

136
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,200
And so what we do instead
in those cases

137
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,634
is we try to ensure
that people are publishing.

138
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:16,567
So, for instance, Jeff Dean
and Sanjay Ghemawat

139
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,501
have done papers on GFS,

140
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:21,634
MapReduce, uh, BigTable.

141
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:25,033
You know, Luiz Barroso did
a paper on, you know,

142
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,467
drive lifetimes.

143
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:29,133
And if they're read
by technical people,

144
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:32,400
they can come up with these
technologies fairly rapidly.

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,534
And, in fact, that's happened
in the open source world

146
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,334
with Hadu and with HBase

147
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:38,434
and with some of the other
things that we've created.

148
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,534
So I'm actually really happy
about this, you know?

149
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,667
I think it's really important
that actually

150
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,901
GFS has an open source
competitor.

151
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,667
Because it both keeps us
honest,

152
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,567
but also, if it gets
better than what we have,

153
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:50,634
we can just adopt it.

154
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:51,901
Man: Exactly.

155
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,634
DiBona: So we don't feel
competitive with Hadu.

156
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,667
But the other side of this is
is there's some software

157
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:01,834
that if we release, we make
the internet worse, right?

158
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,434
And that would be like
if we released, uh,

159
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,100
the information of how
we do web ranking,

160
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,601
page ranking
for the web search.

161
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,901
Then web spammers
would get hold of it,

162
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,567
and that would be
a very big problem.

163
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,901
And not just for Google,

164
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,434
but for Yahoo and Microsoft
as well.

165
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,901
Well, I firmly believe,
and quality numbers bear out,

166
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,234
that Google gives the best
search on the internet.

167
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:22,901
And part of that has to do

168
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,634
with how we look at these people
who abuse the internet

169
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,868
and change how those results
are displayed to end users.

170
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,701
So if we were to let
that information out,

171
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,734
it would make things very,
very bad for not just us

172
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:34,734
but for Yahoo
and Microsoft too.
