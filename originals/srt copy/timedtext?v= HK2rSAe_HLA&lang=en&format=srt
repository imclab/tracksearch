Hi! My name is Colt MCAnlis, and I am a Developer
Advocate for Native Client. In this video,

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,730
I am going to explain how you can get started
using Native Client to create applications.

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,410
The first thing you need to do is get the
SDK and run naclsdk update. This downloads

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,560
and unpacks the up-to-date tools, headers
and libraries that you’ll need to build

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,960
Native Client applications.
Then my recommendation is to become more familiar

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,650
with Pepper. Pepper is a set of bindings that
expose the power of the web platform to C

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,120
and C++, giving your program the same capabilities
that JavaScript has. You can start by running

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,530
some of the examples and inspect their code.
Understanding the build process is also critical.

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,100
Start by running the SCons builders, and then
look at the output.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,750
Once you familiarized yourself with Native
Client’s basic architecture, then you are

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,530
ready to build your project. If you are porting
or building your app from an existing code

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,130
base, then you’ll need to make three key
changes:

13
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,149
First you’ll need to make your C and C++
source code portable; for that use only the

14
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,719
portable dialect of C and C++.
Second you will need to use the Pepper interfaces

15
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,340
to access resources like graphics, audio,
and input devices. This step makes the resulting

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,979
application OS-independent, because Pepper
is an OS-independent API.

17
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,159
Third if your application uses hardware accelerated
graphics, you will need to adapt it to use

18
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,569
OpenGL ES 2.0.
Once your project is done, then you need to

19
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:31,999
package it as a Chrome Web Store app - this
way you will be able to reach more than 200

20
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:36,709
millions Chrome users.
