1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
>> KAY: So, I'd like to take a little bit
of time now to see if we can look at a few

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,600
of these cool extensions that have been made
already. And I'm really happy to be able introduce

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,369
somebody that we've been working with closely
in the community from pretty early on. So,

4
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,810
Colin from Xmarks, come on up and let’s
see your extension.

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,019
>> BLECKNER: Thanks, guys. I'm Colin. I'm
here with Will. We’re Software Developers

6
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,870
for Xmarks. One of our main products is a
Cross Browser Extension that synchronizes

7
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,899
your Bookmarks between different computers
and browsers. And we're happy to be here today

8
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,149
talking about one of our recent projects,
Xmarks for Chrome. We'll start with this quick

9
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,469
demo of Xmarks in action. You can access our
main UI from the Xmarks icon on the top-right.

10
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,280
As you can see, we're currently synchronizing
successfully. And from this page we can also

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,539
access some of our other local settings. Xmarks
icon also gives us a shortcut to my.xmarks.com.

12
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,699
This Website gives you online access to your
Bookmarks from any computer as well as some

13
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,650
of our more advanced online features. And
since we're already synchronizing, you can

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,159
see the bookmarks in those browser that match
up of what you see here in the Bookmark bar

15
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,750
for Chrome. So, to show Xmarks in action,
Will is actually going to delete one of his

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,490
Bookmarks on our website. That means the next
time we sync in Chrome, that deletion will

17
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,579
come down and we’ll move it in Chrome, too.
So, if you go to the Xmarks icon and hit “synchronize

18
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,040
now,” look at that synchronize go, and when
it finishes, that Bookmark should also get

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,229
removed from Chrome. That's taking a little
second. There you go. The Bookmark is gone

20
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,090
there, too. Similarly, if we were to add a
Bookmark in Chrome, or move things around

21
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,450
and then synchronize after that, that change
will go back to our servers and from there,

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,750
out to any other computers and browsers running
Xmarks. As a software developer, there are

23
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,869
a couple of things that I'm excited about
in Chrome. The first is that everything is

24
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:49,020
written in HTML and JavaScript. This makes
it really easy for us to put over our existing

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,390
extensions. Xmarks for example has a lot of
client side code. And we're able to pour it

26
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,969
pretty much all of our core sink code to Chrome
without any changes at all. And we didn’t

27
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,350
just happened to get lucky in this one case.
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at search

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,020
tabs. This is another Xmarks extension that
helps users discover similar sites while they’re

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,330
searching. I got it up and running in Chrome
in less than a day and there's something like

30
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,739
50 Chrome specific lines of code. Everything
else was shared Cross Browser Code. This is

31
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,940
a huge win for us and not just because we
get things up and running so fast, more importantly

32
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,500
for me, it means that maintaining that code
in those extensions is going to be a lot more

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,120
manageable for us in the future. The second
thing I'm excited about is that the extension

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,319
API has access to HTML5 features. When I first
started working on Xmarks for Chrome, one

35
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,780
of the biggest issues I had was figuring out
how to store information on a user’s computer.

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,069
We store a lot of data locally to help speed
up our sink process, but the extension API

37
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,840
doesn't, you know, have any file I/O code
or support. However, HTML5 has things like--it's

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,810
got local storage in SQL data bases. And so,
I was able to take our file I/O code and rewrite

39
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,610
that using this HTML5 features, and everything
else runs smoothly on top of that. Overall,

40
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm pretty excited to be writing extensions
for Chrome. I think that the extension API

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,709
itself really promotes Cross Browser development
and that's going to make it a lot easier for

42
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,390
us to build and maintain our extensions. So,
thanks again, guys. And up next we could got

43
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,390
Jeff talking about Google Translate.
>> JEFF: Hi. I'm Jeff from the Google Translate

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,730
Team. Before I begin, I wanted to just give
a quick shout out to Jerry Tieng (ph). The

45
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:24,860
Engineer who developed the translate extension.
Unfortunately, he couldn't be here. So, I'll

46
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,709
be giving the demo instead. So, let's say
you're searching for the top French news stories,

47
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:37,709
and start by going to google.fr. Since the
content of this page is in French but my browser

48
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:45,959
language is an English, the translate extension
will pop up and prompt me to see if I--whether

49
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,250
or not I want to translate this page into
English. Since I don't speak French, you know,

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:59,250
I'll go ahead and click on translate. And
voila, the page is now instantly translated

51
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,030
into English so I can read and understand
it. So now I'm looking for news, so now, you

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,849
know, I'm able to find news since it’s in
my language. I'll go ahead and click on the

53
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:13,849
news link. And since this next page is also
in French, the translate extension will immediately

54
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:21,270
translate the page as well. So, if the translate
extension looks similar or the same as the

55
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,940
Website translator gadget that's on Google
Translate, well, the reason why is because

56
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,950
it's the same code. Developing the translate
extension was quick and easy because we are

57
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,860
able to leverage the existing code that we've
created. In order to reuse this code though

58
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,300
we had to propose or re-propose to extensions--two
functions to the extensions API. The first

59
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,290
one, detects language, automatically detects
the language of the page and returns it to

60
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,030
us. We use this to determine whether or not
we should prompt and show the standard to

61
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,660
the user to translate the page. The second
function executes script allows us to inject

62
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:08,590
our existing gadget code into the page and
tell the browser to execute it. So in summary,

63
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,610
developing the translate extension for Chrome
was extremely easy and quick because we are

64
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,560
able to reuse and leverage existing code.
And if there's a function that you need that

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,630
doesn't yet exist, you can propose it to the
Chrome team and once approved, you can work

66
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,630
with them to get it implemented. And next,
I'll--Adam from eBay will share with you his

67
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,840
experience.
>> ADAM: Thanks. It's great to be here. You

68
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,240
know, it's been a long time since we started
eBay as just a Website. Ever since we first

69
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,320
launched our public APIs in 2000, we really
viewed eBay as an E-commerce platform, where

70
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,120
our customers can buy and sell wherever they
are, really creating a new and much more robust

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,690
site than what we had before. And we sort
of called this policy “eBay anywhere.”

72
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,530
We want our customers whether they're using
a mobile device, whether on eBay.com, whether

73
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,800
they're using a desktop gadget to experience
eBay wherever they are. And that's why development

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,770
environment, such as, Google Chrome are so
important to us because we know that many

75
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,290
of our customers do use Chrome. And we want
them to have fantastic experience when they

76
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,230
do so. Now, I'm going to give a quick demo
of an extension that one of our team has been

77
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,680
working on. Just like the Translate Team,
Diane Forch [PH], she couldn't be here today

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,250
because they are in London. But I'm going
to do a demo on their behalf. So, again, it

79
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,890
doesn't matter. You could be on a page, you
know, searching news at google.fr. And you

80
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,180
say, “Hey, I want to check to see what's
going on eBay.” And so, we have a menu right

81
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,330
here and you can go and click and find out
what's going on. I'm already signed in, so

82
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,930
you can see I’m sort of watching a couple
items: Lego Star Wars, new sneakers. I’m

83
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,860
going to say, “Oh, maybe I want to get that.”
You know, but wanting more information, you

84
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,610
know, you can sort of click and see more and
sort of just little fade, it moves over, and

85
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,540
you can see all the information you want to
know about the item, or and, actually, if

86
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,380
you want to, you can go and place more, go
and actually place the bid. Alternately, this

87
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,660
is sort of what we call “my eBay interface.”
And so, those are active items. We also have

88
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,280
ended items, right? These are all the things
that I've been watching or buying or lost.

89
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,680
And if I say, “Hey, I want to try to find
that. Hey, what was that item that I just

90
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,830
won? ”Well, then I can just sort of click
here, pull up a little menu and do a filter

91
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,180
in place just to find the item that I won,
and there it appears, right? So now, it's

92
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,880
changed so I should leave a bid to lead feedback.
So, everything is sort of in context, in place,

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,020
really easy to filter it. Of course, we also
have the ubiquitous search box, so I could

94
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,250
look for kittens, for example, but, you know,
we actually have policy. You can’t sell

95
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:48,250
kittens on eBay, so. So, I won't do that because
Lord knows what might show up. Sorry, do it

96
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,130
yourself. Anyway, so, once again, we really
enjoyed, it’s really a fun experience writing

97
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,410
the extension. The integrated development
environment, which you sort of saw earlier,

98
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:09,360
made it much easier for us to build and debug
it. Also, we have existing extensions for

99
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,860
other browsers and similar to what you also,
again, heard before, it was very easy for

100
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,330
us to port over our code. All the business
logic, this one straight over, and then we

101
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,420
had to go and tackle the UI that we just have
to do that for Chrome, and that made, again,

102
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,630
keeping all of our code basis in synch nice
and easy. In fact, that's one of the things

103
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,080
that we really took advantage of when we were
doing the design with the HTML5 and CSS3 to

104
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,970
do what we really wanted, because Chrome has
a different approach as you learned. More

105
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,580
minimal approach to user interface and we
had to figure out how do we tackle that problem,

106
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,270
you know, while we're miming Webby and also
eBay. And so, those were really great. I sort

107
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,490
of thinking about how to handle it and also
we want with a sort of a mobile approach,

108
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,480
because they both have in some ways that are
restrained, real stay, and smaller UI that

109
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,870
needs to get done. And so, when we tackle
that, we said, “Hey, we can take advantage

110
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,970
of CSS3 to do rounded corners and gradients
for the background.” Things that we had

111
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,030
done before, but we had to put image hacks
and things we didn’t like. So this was much

112
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:18,960
cleaner and really simplified our presentation
logic. Likewise, with HTML5, we will to go

113
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,650
much more or beyond the fact that we have
cookies, right? So with eBay, there are a

114
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,120
lot of user preferences, there's a lot of
data for each of the items that you can be

115
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,950
watching up to 200. In this case, we were
able to use the Name Value Pair Database for

116
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,950
all of our preferences. We've able to use
the SQLite database to store all the items

117
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,400
and made it very for us to really keep all
the information right here and improve the

118
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,060
speed and efficiency, which is, again, something
that we really want to make sure our customers

119
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,440
experience. So overall, we really had a fantastic
time with working with the Chrome Team and

120
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,770
we really want to thank them for all the support
that they've given us. The best part from

121
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:59,360
my standpoint is when we built this extension,
everything we saw here those are our public

122
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,270
APIs. We don't have to make any changes to
our own APIs to implement this. So, any developer

123
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,270
whether it’s eBay or anyone in this room
or anyone in the Internet, can go and build

124
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,820
that right now. And so, we really hope that
developers will see this as a great opportunity

125
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,820
for them to use Chrome as a platform to extend
and great fantastic extensions for our community.

126
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,730
So, if anybody wants to talk to me, I'll be
out of here later. And so, now I'm going to

127
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,890
hand it over to Nick from Google.
