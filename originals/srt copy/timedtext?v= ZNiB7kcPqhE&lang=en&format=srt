00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
>> SALMI: My name is Deborah Salmi and I work
in marketing for Web of Trust. Web of Trust

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:17,330
or WOT for short was founded in 2006 by two
university post-graduate students from Finland.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,240
Both worked as researchers in the field of
computer security and data mining. During

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,080
their research, they came up with the idea
of creating a reputation system for the web.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,660
The goal was to make the internet a safer
place for everyone, make it more democratic

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,110
and to give everyone a chance to contribute
to this objective.

7
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,290
>> What is your extension about?
>> SALMI: The average web user wants to know

8
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:51,059
which websites they can trust. The WOT add-on
is a safe surfing tool for your browser. It

9
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,129
shows you traffic-light-style rating symbols
that tell you which websites you can trust

10
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,920
for safe surfing, shopping, and searching
on the web. Many experienced users--they want

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,119
to contribute to web safety. WOT rating is
powered by a global community of millions

12
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,469
of trustworthy users who've rated millions
of websites based on their experiences.

13
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:17,689
>> How did your vision evolve as you were
working on your extension?

14
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:24,140
>> SALMI: We had a clear vision of our extension
from the beginning. This was our third browser

15
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:31,140
platform. The first version of our extension
used a toolstrip and a mole for its user interface.

16
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,920
But we've had a UI similar to Chrome's browser
actions for years now on other browser platforms.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,570
And we're very happy to see the Chrome team
ultimately decided to go with browser actions

18
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,289
instead.
>> How difficult was it to integrate with

19
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,450
your existing service?
>> SALMI: Well, integration with our existing

20
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,799
service, it was easy. We have a web service
API, and we use HTML HTTP request to access

21
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,700
it from all our other extensions too.
>> What did you enjoy most about writing your

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,840
extension?
>> SALMI: We like the fact that it's easy

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,840
to reload and test extensions without restarting
the browser. Chrome's developer tools were

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,750
a great help in debugging the extension as
well.

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,550
>> What were some challenges you faced when
writing your extension?

26
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:23,550
>> SALMI: We would have liked to see some
additional APIs for cryptographic primitives,

27
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:31,019
hash functions especially, URL parsing, IDN
conversions for example. So we ended up implementing

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,870
these in Java Script instead.
>> Was there a particular technical challenge

29
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,469
you faced in which you gave an innovative
solution?

30
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:47,469
>> SALMI: Chrome was initially lacking a full
internationalization framework, so we decided

31
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:52,280
to implement our own because we wanted to
support multiple languages right from the

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,900
beginning. So later, the internationalization
framework Chrome team implemented, it was

33
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,079
almost identical to ours. Supporting the extension
to use it was trivial.

34
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,629
>> What do you think about Google Chrome's
decision to use CSS, HTML and JavaScript as

35
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:11,349
the basis of its extension framework?
>> SALMI: It was brilliant--brilliant decision.

36
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:18,349
Chrome's move to use HTML, JavaScript and
CSS to create extensions was a brilliant decision,

37
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,319
and it makes developing extensions possible
for anyone with web development experience.

38
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,629
It's a lot easier to develop extensions for
Chrome than for other platforms. Also the

39
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:36,349
fact that extensions are just web pages, it
gives Chrome a natural way to sandbox them

40
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,499
from each other and from the privileged browser
process.

41
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:46,499
>> How many times have you updated your extension?
>> SALMI: We've had 12 updates since the initial

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,469
release. And updating the extension through
the website, it's really quick and it's convenient.

43
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,879
And we especially like the fact that there's
no need to wait for a human review before

44
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,480
the extension is published to users. So combined
with Chrome's automatic extension updates,

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,390
this makes distributing bug fixes and new
features to our users very convenient. And

46
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,810
you know, we've noticed that Chrome users
are far more likely to use the latest version

47
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,509
of our extension than users who have other
browsers.

48
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:23,250
>> How did you promote your extension?
>> SALMI: Our user community was all a buzz

49
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,630
about Chrome, so when the dev channel and
then later the beta channel was released,

50
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,130
we blogged, we tweeted about it, and many
WOT fans tried it out. And because we made

51
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,260
sure we were one of the first extensions to
be completed for Chrome, many of the respected

52
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,260
tech sites included WOT in the "must-have"
list for Chrome. So now, we are working on

53
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:55,510
updating our website and featuring WOT for
Chrome more prominently. Part of that is educating

54
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,270
users that they have a choice when it comes
to browsers. But whichever browser they choose,

55
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,510
we want WOT to be part of their safe-surfing
experience.

56
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,889
>> What advice can you give someone before
starting to work on a Google Chrome extension?

57
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,360
>> SALMI: Developers who are starting work
on a Chrome extension, they should carefully

58
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,580
think about the architecture of their extension
and decide early on what they want in the

59
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,350
background page and what should be done in
content scripts. If they plan to localize

60
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,000
the extension, it's a good thing to prepare
for that from the very beginning.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,070
>> Come meet the Web of Trust team, at the
Google IO conference.
