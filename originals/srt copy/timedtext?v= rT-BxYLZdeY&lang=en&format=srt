Alex Willen: Box is a cloud content
management company.

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:10,250
We provide online storage and
collaboration features for businesses.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,000
So, it's like a file system in the cloud,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,542
but with a software layer on top of it

6
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:16,208
that allows you to easily
share content with others.

7
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,375
And while we provide sort of
the online version of a hard drive

8
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,250
that allows you to store
your content online,

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,542
Chrome takes it one step further

10
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,833
by taking the entire operating
system online.

11
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,875
Jeremy Glassenberg: Our first integration
with Chrome was a single sign-on solution,

12
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,667
so that any Google user
who was utilizing Chrome--

13
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,375
either the Chrome OS or the browser--

14
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,292
has an easy way of accessing Box
through the App Store.

15
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:41,167
So, we enjoy the fact that any files
you traditionally work with

16
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,292
through the Chrome OS 

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,000
can easily go right into Box
and from there,

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,542
interact with your customers,

19
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:48,917
with your co-workers,

20
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:51,625
and with the other Google services
that you're used to.

21
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,250
We especially like the latest update
that Chrome's providing,

22
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,625
where if you have content on your desktop,
on your Chrome device,

23
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,292
you're getting it into your Chrome device.

24
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:04,375
It's very easy to get it
from Chrome onto the cloud.

25
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,250
And with the Box APIs, 

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,417
as was acknowledged
by the Google Chrome team,

27
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:12,542
it was very easy to connect
our APIs to Chrome's APIs

28
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,083
so that just in a matter of days, 

29
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,792
we were able to get files
uploading from Chrome into Box.

30
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,542
Alex Willen: So yeah, we're very excited
to be integrated into Chrome OS.

31
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,625
It's pretty simple,
which is the way we like things.

32
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,250
If you have, for example, a USB drive,
and you plug it into your Chrome OS notebook,

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,167
you'll see that content in Chrome OS
in their file browser.

34
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,625
You easily just select a file,
click "Upload to Box,

35
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,292
pick what directory you want it
to go into and it uploads right away.

36
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,125
It's a very simple, two-click process.

37
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:45,125
