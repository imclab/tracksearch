PETE LEPAGE: Well
hey, everybody.

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,280
My name's Pete LePage.

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,310
I'm a developer advocate with
the Chrome Team working on

22
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,590
Chrome Apps.

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,960
Today, I want to talk to you
about the Text-To-Speech API,

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,070
one of the cool new
APIs that are

25
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,790
available with Chrome Apps.

26
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,290
As you saw, we had a little demo
there that took what I

27
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,060
had to say, used the
Text-To-Speech API and was

28
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,090
able to convert that from
text into the speech.

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,750
So you can use this for
all kinds of different

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,860
applications.

31
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,500
Whether you want to have a
clock that talks to you,

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,020
whether you want to have an
application that alerts you

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,820
when you get new text messages,
or anything else

34
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,940
that you might want to have
a voice coming out of your

35
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,700
computer for any kind
of experience.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,940
So with that, I figure we might
as well just jump in and

37
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,910
have a look at the
application.

38
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,620
So let's bring up some
code and the app.

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,580
So here, we've got
the application.

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,210
Let me just move my computer
to a place where I can more

41
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,010
easily access it here.

42
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,540
And you'll notice that there's
a couple of things in this

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,220
text box that I've got going.

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,330
I've got a text box that
I can edit in here.

45
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,670
So I can say, the
rain in Spain.

46
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,190
Spain stays mainly
in the plain.

47
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,730
Right?

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,320
And I can click on
the Speak button.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,870
Sure enough--

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,850
It helps if I turn
the volume up.

you'll notice that it

my extra S on there.

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,850
But it says the words that it's

69
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,820
speaking as it moves through.

70
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,680
So I'm going to walk you through
how I went about going

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,810
and using the Text-To-Speech
API, but as well, how I went

72
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,470
and got it to highlight the
different words as it moved

73
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,650
through the different pieces.

74
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,060
So let's bring up some code here
and, before we jump into

75
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,870
the actual app, let's
take a look at the

76
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,850
code behind the app.

77
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,130
So I started, in this particular
case, with just the

78
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,850
simple Hello, World example
because I figured that was the

79
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,630
easiest place for me
to get started.

80
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,110
It was just a nice,
easy place to go.

81
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,630
I used the Bootstrap UI to make
things look kind of nice,

82
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,050
as just a starting place.

83
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,600
Just a real easy thing.

84
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,890
So you can see here, I've got
the Bootstrap CSS framework,

85
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,100
and then I've got my own custom
set of styles so that I

86
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,630
can have a certain set
of things in there.

87
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,860
If we have a look at that custom
set of styles, all I've

88
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,810
gone and done is I just put
some special styling on my

89
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,540
container so that I'd have just
enough for that top block

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,390
to be there.

91
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,420
And as well, I created
this highlight class.

92
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,270
The highlight class
is what's actually

93
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,750
highlighting each word.

94
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,620
So each word, when it gets
highlighted, has that class

95
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,730
added to it and removed
from it.

96
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,190
So that's the CSS behind this.

97
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,240
If we go back and have a look
at the application, you can

98
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,945
ignore this top little bit.

99
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:17,970
This is where we've got the
toolbar across the top.

100
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,019
So if I bring the app
back up here.

101
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,470
Let me just bring it
up here real quick.

102
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,870
Right so, here we go.

103
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,220
There's my top navbar
so that you can see

104
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,650
what's going on there.

105
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,690
I didn't do anything special
with it because I just wanted

106
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,860
to get something in
really quickly.

107
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,590
But then here in my container,
I've done a couple of things.

108
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,960
So I've got a form element that
I've said form inline.

109
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,250
So that styles the Bootstrap
stuff, so that I've got my

110
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,860
text in line with the button.

111
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,510
Now I've got my text input here,
and I've set it so that

112
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,510
it's a type text.

113
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,480
And I've given it an ID because
I'm going to need to

114
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,120
grab it in a second.

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,690
I've specified how big I
want the input to be.

116
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,190
And I've also put in a little
place holder, so that if we go

117
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,680
and get rid of any of the text
in here, we always will see

118
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,360
"say something" so that we
know that that's where we

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,930
should go type and provide
our information.

120
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,850
I've got a button that, by
default, is disabled.

121
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,300
We'll talk about why I've
got it disabled to

122
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,210
begin with in a sec.

123
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,960
And it's type button
with an ID.

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,920
And the class button is what
defines the styling for the

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,510
Bootstrap button.

126
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,800
And then a little bit further
down, I have a paragraph where

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,510
I've actually gone in to find
all of my word lists.

128
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,030
So this is where we're going
to go in and insert all the

129
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,540
words as we start iterating
through these.

130
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,110
Let's take a quick look at the
manifest file, because the

131
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,300
manifest file is
pretty simple.

132
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,980
There's nothing really complex
to it or anything like that.

133
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,730
It's a pretty standard
manifest file.

134
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,180
Again, I just grabbed this from
the Hello, World sample.

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,320
The only thing that really
changes that I want to

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,480
highlight here is in the
permissions element.

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,190
So in the permissions element,
what I've done is I've added

138
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,640
permissions for TTS,
so Text-To-Speech.

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,660
And that's the Chrome
Text-To-Speech element.

140
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,100
The only other thing that I
did was I moved my main.js

141
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,570
into a JavaScript folder because
I like to keep all my

142
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,690
JavaScript off into its own
little space so that it's not

143
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,590
sitting in my root
of the directory.

144
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,190
So if we actually look at that,
you could see it's just

145
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,510
a standard main.js.

146
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,470
We go and create a window that
opens index at about 500

147
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,790
pixels wide and 309
pixels in height.

148
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,640
So that's going to go
and open our window.

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,500
It's going to give us our
Text-To-Speech permission.

150
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,220
So we're pretty much good
to go at this point.

151
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,050
So at this point, let's go and
actually take a look at what's

152
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,200
going on with our code.

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,310
But before I do that, I want
to mention that, as with

154
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,000
pretty much all of our Chrome
Hangouts, if you have

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,250
questions, if you've got
comments, if you want to know

156
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,030
what's going on with some of
these, feel free to post your

157
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,580
questions at our
moderator page.

158
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,250
The link is there onscreen.

159
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,030
I'll leave it onscreen for the
next couple minutes so that as

160
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm walking through this, you
can go ahead and post your

161
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,270
questions and ask
what's going on.

162
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,900
All right.

163
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,580
Now, I kind of put this example
together in a quick

164
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,820
and dirty fashion, and some
of the things I did here I

165
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,700
wouldn't recommend doing
for a production app.

166
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,550
But it at least gives you a good
idea of how to go about

167
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,180
doing some of these things.

168
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,970
So I created three variables,
because I was going to need to

169
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,970
access these fairly
frequently.

170
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,860
So my speakInput, which is my
text box, my btnSpeak, which

171
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,670
is the button that the user
clicks when they want to go

172
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,210
and hit a button, and
then the wordList.

173
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,580
So that's the paragraph
that we've got.

174
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,160
And in my jQuery Document Ready
function, I go and I

175
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
just grab those right
off the bat.

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
So that way I've always
got them.

177
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,490
I don't have to go keep
searching for them every time

178
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,600
the user hits a button,
or anything like that.

179
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,860
It's a good performance
technique.

180
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,020
Obviously, in something like
this, it's maybe not the most

181
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,030
important thing to have because
this is such a simple

182
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,909
example, but I wanted to
just go stick this in

183
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,540
there, and go from that.

184
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,870
So I go and grab my speakInput,
which is the text

185
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,250
box, I grab the button, and
I grab the wordList.

186
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,150
And then I bind with a click.

187
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,670
So when the user clicks on the
button, they actually go in

188
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,040
and call the saySomething
function.

189
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,740
Now the other thing that I did
is I added a removeAttr

190
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,240
disabled here.

191
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,010
So that way, that button is
not enabled until our

192
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,260
document's ready.

193
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,330

194
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,880
The user is not going to be able
to do something before

195
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,890
your UI is ready, so disabling
buttons when they're not

196
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,990
available is just one of those
things that generally is a

197
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:35,590
good practice, good thing
to keep an eye on.

198
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,500
So now let's take a look at
our saySomething function.

199
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,250
So this is the function that
gets called when the user goes

200
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,760
and clicks on Say Something.

201
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,891
So let me pop over here,
and when I say, yes--

PETE LEPAGE: --sure
enough, that's the

206
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,600
function that gets called.

207
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,790
So let's take a look.

208
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,290
So the first thing I wanted to
do is get my list of words.

209
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,880
So I just go and use the val
from the input, and I just put

210
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,920
all of those words
into an array.

211
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,390
And I split those into
an array of words.

212
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,320
Now, I split them into an
array of words because I

213
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,210
wanted to know where all the
different words existed.

214
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,230
So that as I went through and
highlighted each, as the

215
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,520
computer said each word, I
could highlight each one.

216
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,470
So actually I'm going to go and
I'm going to stick in a

217
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,170
console.log, "Words," colon,
and we'll add words.

218
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,610
Just so that when we have a look
this here in a sec, we

219
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,890
can see what's going on.

220
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,580
So the next thing that happens
is that I take the wordList,

221
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,280
and I get rid of everything
in there.

222
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,950
Because we don't care what was
in there before, so we want to

223
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,690
go through and clear
everything out.

224
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:04,330
And then I want to go through,
and I add all of the words

225
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,960
into a span.

226
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:16,460
So each word becomes its own
span inside my wordList.

227
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,170
So I go through and add each
of those guys in there.

228
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,750
And I just say, span, word,
text, go in, stick each one

229
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,530
in, and then append
it to my wordList.

230
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,180
Now, probably not the best way
to do this because in this

231
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,380
particular case, I am having
to refer to that each one.

232
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,130
And going in and appending, and
appending, and appending,

233
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,120
and appending ends up being a
pretty expensive DOM task.

234
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,850
The better way to do this would
have been to create an

235
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,820
element that I would have
wrapped everything in, put

236
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,030
everything into that particular
element, and then

237
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,520
just added that one single
element to my page.

238
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,570
Depending on how much time we
have, we might go in and add

239
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,620
that in a sec.

240
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,860
So now I use the Chrome
Text-To-Speech API.

241
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,310
And the Chrome Text-To-Speech
API, let me just pull that guy

242
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,250
out for a sec here.

243
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,870
You can get the documentation
for the Chrome Text-To-Speech

244
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,540
API here if you go
and look at that.

245
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,790
But there's a couple of things
that you can do with this.

246
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,250
So the easiest API that you can
use is chrome.tts.speak

247
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,120
and you provide it
with a string.

248
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,100
And it goes and it'll say
whatever you wanted it to say.

249
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,780
It's an asynchronous call.

250
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,640
Keep that in mind.

251
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,180
So that you say, hey, I want
you to go say this.

252
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,280
And it's going to immediately
come back and say, OK, great

253
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,410
I'm saying this.

254
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,870
And the rest of your JavaScript
is running.

255
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,170
So that means you're
not waiting for

256
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,960
it to finish speaking.

257
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,540
It also means that you can use
this text-to-speech stop to

258
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,170
stop it from saying anything.

259
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,090
If it's still continually
talking and you're like, oh

260
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,950
hey, I don't want you to
keep talking anymore,

261
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,690
you can have it stop.

262
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,010
But then there's a bunch of
functions and parameters that

263
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,730
you can provide.

264
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,100
And the interesting one
that I used, was

265
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,600
the callback function.

266
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,530
So let me actually
go back to here.

267
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,290
So you can see here we said
Chrome Text-To-Speech toSay,

268
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,680
which is the list of words that
we want the user to say.

269
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,010
Right?

270
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,570
And then I provided a couple
of parameters.

271
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,230
So one parameter I provided
was the rate.

272
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,440
So 1.0 would be a normal pace.

273
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,520
Increasing that to a higher
number will be

274
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,940
have them speak faster.

275
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,310
Decreasing that number,
they're going to speak

276
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:53,240
(SPEAKING SLOWLY) more slowly,
and they're not going to sound

277
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,180
very interesting.

278
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,210
So I thought that 1.0 actually
sounded a little too fast, so

279
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,270
that's why I put
it down at 0.8.

280
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,640
Now, the next piece I added
was an onEvent function.

281
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,360
The onEvent function fires under
a number of different

282
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,270
events, but the one that I
thought was the coolest was

283
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,550
the word function.

284
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,870
So on every word that
Chrome says, it

285
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,030
fires this word function.

286
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:30,510
So I checked to see what the
word function is, and go in

287
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,970
and add that and check
to see if it's there.

288
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,120
It comes back and it gives me
the character index of where

289
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,090
that word is.

290
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,670
So that I can see OK,
well, this is--

291
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,060
it's starting at this character,
or this character

292
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,680
as it says something.

293
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,030
Then I find all spans that have
the highlight, and I want

294
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,130
to go and remove them.

295
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,240
Because I'm not interested in
highlighting anything else.

296
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,300
I only want to highlight
the active word.

297
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,310
Now, this is one place where I
got a little goofed up when I

298
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,090
first did this.

299
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,190
Actually, let's take a look
at what I just added here,

300
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,140
because the words that
I split out don't

301
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,900
actually split by word.

302
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,160
It actually splits
by character.

303
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,050
So if I pull this
guy up-- whoop.

304
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,070
I guess I have to do these.

305
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,510
All right.

306
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:33,130
So let's pull this up again,
and let's reload this.

307
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,810
And we'll have a look at
what's going on here.

308
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,060
And--

309

313
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,410
PETE LEPAGE: So sure enough,
there's the rain in Spain

314
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,880
stays mainly in the plain.

315
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,010
You'll notice that it's
broken down each

316
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,090
letter into each piece.

317
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,840
Now the reason I had to break
down each letter, is that

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,550
Chrome considers words to be
something that I didn't

319
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,460
consider words to be.

320
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,930
Chrome considers words to be
what I would traditionally

321
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,980
consider a word.

322
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,090
But a comma is considered
a word.

323
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,650
So if you'll notice just that
simple "the rain in Spain," it

324
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,580
thinks that is a word.

325
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,310
So what I went and did is I
said, OK, well we need to just

326
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,100
highlight each piece until
we find the end of what I

327
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,460
consider to be a word.

328
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,950
So let me pop back
to our code here.

329
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:44,000
And I go through and I say,
while we're in a word, add the

330
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,700
highlight to that word.

331
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,650
And we do it by the index.

332
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:57,200
And we keep going until either
we find the end of the string,

333
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,430
or we find a space at
the end of our text.

334
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,160

335
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,319
So if words start is undefined,
or if words start

336
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,410
dot text equals space, then
we've finished with our word.

337
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:20,900
So if we do that, that breaks
down each individual word.

338
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,099
Once we hit the end, we're
going to finish with the

339
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,640
particular space.

340
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,016
So let's actually go in and
console.log(event).

341
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:35,670

342
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,060
So that we can see what's being
passed in, and how each

343
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,700
word comes in and how
long each word is.

344
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
All right.

345
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,170
And then we've just got an empty
function for any kind

346
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,440
errors or anything like that.

347
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:57,470
So I'm going to save this guy,
and we'll reload this.

348
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:04,350
And Inspect, so that we bring
up for our console.

349
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,520
And bring up our Developer
Console, and go ahead and

350
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,100
Speak this.

351
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,720
Now, I've got it muted so that
you don't hear each piece, but

352
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,930
let me move this in so
that you can see this

353
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,560
a little bit better.

354
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,070
OK, we'll do that.

355
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,540
And sure enough.

356
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:33,010
So you can see we've got an
object that's the start with

357
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,090
our character index of 0.

358
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,780
There's no error message.

359
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,230
Then the second one, we
start our first word.

360
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,500
And our first word goes
from 0 to something.

361
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,190
It doesn't actually tell
us where it ends.

362
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,990
And then our second word
starts at character 4.

363
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,700
OK, so there is character
0, 1, 2, 3, and so sure

364
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,810
enough there's 4.

365
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,510
Let me bring up a slightly
different example, where we

366
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,620
can see this a little
bit more clearly.

367
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,290
So I'm going to put a comma
right in the very beginning.

368
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,870

369
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,600
Hello, world.

370
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,850
Of course.

371
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,730

372
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,330
So sure enough--

373
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,450
I'm just going to clear my
console here, so we can see

374
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,670
this a little bit better.

375
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,930
So "Hello, world."

376
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,490
So sure enough, you see right
off the bat we have start, we

377
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,840
have hello at 0.

378
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,050
We have word at 5 characters,
so that we can go in, and we

379
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,810
can go to our 5 characters
in, which is the comma.

380
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,180
And then world starts at 7.

381
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,320
So we've got, "Hello, world."
We start with our next word.

382
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,190
We highlight the next
thing and highlight

383
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,580
that as it goes on.

384
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,510
So you can see it's a pretty
simple example to be able to

385
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,620
go through and highlight each
of the sets of words, as we

386
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,850
move through.

387
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,450
And it's a pretty quick, easy
way to be able to go in and

388
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,370
say, all right, well, I want
something to go to speak, or I

389
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,890
want something to be able to go
and add in whatever else is

390
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,570
we particularly want.

391
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,380
Now it looks like our friend
Renato has just joined us.

392
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,970
So I'm going to bring
Renato in here.

393
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,420
One second.

394
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,770
Let me just close something up
real quick, and bring him in.

395
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,950
And Renato, how you doing?

396
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,540

397
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,695
I'm not hearing you there.

398
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:50,945
Yeah.

399
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:53,870

400
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,120
All right.

401
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,070

402
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,170
One sec, let me see if I can
change something real fast.

403
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:14,236

404
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:15,770
All right.

405
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,450
Looks like I'm not hearing
Renato right now, so we'll

406
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,930
have Renato join us on another
Hangout on a future date.

407
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,010
So with that, I want to open
it up to any questions that

408
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,520
you guys have.

409
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,740
Actually, before I do
that, what I'll do--

410
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,770
the sample that I wrote, you
can go and grab that.

411
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,740
The link is onscreen.

412
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,260
If you want to go in and pull
that up so that you can try

413
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,390
this out yourself.

414
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,290
See how it works.

415
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,540
It's just up on my
GitHub account.

416
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,450
You can go and grab that
from there, and see how

417
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,710
it works for you.

418
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,020
But with that, I'll open
it up to questions.

419
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,950
Let me pull them up, and see
if we've got any good, fun

420
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,966
questions for us this week.

421
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,216
All right.

422
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:16,170

423
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,790
All right, so we've got a
couple questions here.

424
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,370
So the first question, "Since
this is a Chrome API, does it

425
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,050
only work with the
Chrome browser.

426
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:31,090
Or if I had to format it in
HTML, would it also work in

427
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,940
Safari?"

428
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,470
So this is a particular feature
of Chrome Apps.

429
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,120
So it's not going to work in
Safari, or in Firefox, or

430
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,780
anything like that.

431
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,260
It's got to be within a Chrome
app, or it can also work in a

432
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,530
Chrome extension as
well, I believe.

433
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,800
Pretty sure about that one.

434
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,600
I haven't used that one
in a little while.

435
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,790
But you can use that
within Chrome Apps.

436
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,935
There is a new Text-To-Speech
API.

437
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,910

438
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,610
It's either a Text-To-Speech API
or Speech-To-Text API that

439
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,520
just landed as part of the Open
Web Platform, that you

440
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,640
may be able to use
and check out.

441
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,330
It's a pretty useful one and
really kind of cool.

442
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,060
Because it will allow you to
do a lot of things that

443
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,350
developers have been asking for
for quite some time and

444
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,410
just simply haven't been able
to do with the stuff that

445
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,370
they've got going on.

446
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,060
So let's see if there's
another question here.

447
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,070
All right.

448
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,220
So the next question is, "Where
are some of the things

449
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,850
you would might run into
problems when using this?"

450
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,800
So the couple of things that
I ran into when I was doing

451
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,890
this, one was really around
the piece of understanding

452
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,590
which words are coming out.

453
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,140
Because it only gives you
that start piece.

454
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,930
And the things that Chrome
thinks are words, like a

455
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,330
comma, a period, perhaps
a new paragraph.

456
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,710
I actually didn't try
that in my code.

457
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,950
Those may come across as
something a little bit odd.

458
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,630
So you'll need to experiment
with those a little bit.

459
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,860
The other thing that you'll just
have to make sure that

460
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,510
you do is make sure that you've
got the Chrome TTS API

461
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,800
enabled, so that way you
can go and use this.

462
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,680
In fact, let me bring up the
docs again, one sec.

463
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,430

464
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:47,350
So if you have a look here in
the docs, it does go through

465
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,510
and have a pretty good set of
documentation about some of

466
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,470
the other things that
you can do.

467
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,020
So it talks about the listening
for events with the

468
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,680
different pieces.

469
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,490
Unfortunately, I couldn't get
in Chrome Canary the SSML

470
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,770
markup to work.

471
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,240
I'm going to go check to see if
that was a problem with my

472
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,540
implementation, or if that's
maybe a bug in Chrome.

473
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,670
And file a bug.

474
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,960
So just keep an eye out on our
Google Developers page for a

475
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,070
little bit more information
about that.

476
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,490
One of the other things that I
thought was kind of neat that

477
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,000
you can do is actually be able
to go and choose a couple of

478
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,250
different voices.

479
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,270

480
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,400
So you heard when I
did it earlier.

481
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,850
Let me pull this guy out to see
if I could find this and

482
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,870
bring it up.

483
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,170
Right?

484
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:45,470

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,750

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

492
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,720
PETE LEPAGE: You hear "hello,
world." It's there.

493
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,180
It kind of sounds like
a robotic male voice.

494
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,460
It's not exactly very great to
be able to tell what's going

495
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,590
on or anything like that.

496
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,530
With something like that, what
you could do is change to a

497
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,390
different voice.

498
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:17,400
Now, when I ran through the
sample code here, again, it

499
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,970
turned out that on my particular
computer, I

500
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,070
couldn't get it to come up
with many other voices.

501
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,100
It only had the one
default voice.

502
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,780
So it depends on the different
computer that you've got what

503
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,070
voices you may have access to,
and whether you can change

504
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,360
from a male to a female, whether
you can maybe add a

505
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,430
British accent, or Canadian
accent, where everybody says

506
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,360
"oot and aboot." That
kind of fun stuff.

507
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,250
So it's a quick easy way to be
able to change the accents and

508
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,550
that kind of stuff.

509
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,800
All right.

510
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,020

511
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,360
So with that, it's a pretty
simple sample.

512
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,360
And let me put the link it up
again so that we can see, and

513
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,840
you can grab that if you want.

514
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:15,940
But the sample code is there
at goo.gl/PJSdM And you can

515
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,840
grab that code.

516
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,090
You can go play with it.

517
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,580

518
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,620
Jim's just posted, "Does
it work with the French

519
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,460
language?" Yeah, it does.

520
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,550
So basically the way that it
does this is it does it either

521
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,400
locally on your computer, or it
potentially it may go up to

522
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,690
the cloud and use Google
services to go in and do the

523
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,380
translation.

524
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:50,850
So in fact, Jim let me try this,
and we'll see how good

525
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,810
its accent is.

526
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,460
Let's pop this guy up here.

527
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,260
So here, I'll make it nice
and big for us, so

528
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,380
we can see it here.

529
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,380
So I've got, "Bon jour." My
French is awful, but--

-Bonjour.

[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

533
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,760
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, its
French accent is

534
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,070
about as bad as mine.

535
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,140
But you may be able to set it
into the French language.

536
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,970
In fact, let's have
a quick peek.

537
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,900
If I bring the docs back
up here, I believe

538
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,340
that you can set.

539
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,830
Yeah, so here, TTS Voice
Language, you can set the

540
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,160
language that you
want it to use.

541
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,990
So by default it's going to use
whichever the user is in.

542
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:44,220
But you could change it to
FRFR, or FRCA, or ZHFR,

543
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,190
whatever language you
particularly want it to use.

544
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,870
So it's really possible
to do a lot of

545
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,620
neat things with this.

546
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,300
You can go to the male, the
female voice, or anything like

547
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,660
that pretty quickly, pretty
easily without having to do

548
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,670
too much crazy stuff.

549
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,500
So with that, I'm going to
wrap it up for this week.

550
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,110
It's a little bit of a
short one this week.

551
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,450
But I say thank you
guys very much.

552
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,490
Hope you enjoyed this.

553
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,140
We'll be back next week.

554
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,470
Paul, Renato, and the rest
of the crew will be here.

555
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,550
And we'll jump in, and talk
about some more cool Chrome

556
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,790
Apps stuff.

557
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,570
All right, everybody,
thanks a lot.

558
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,220
Have a great day.
