00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
>> BAUM: Thank you. These are really great
extensions. Hi. My name is Nick. I'm the Product

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,340
Manager on the Extensions Project. And I'd
like to tell you a little bit about the gallery

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,709
that we launched yesterday. So first, let
me close down some of these tabs. And I'm

4
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:21,100
also going to head over and uninstall Aaron's
extension. Not because I don't like it, but

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,100
because I have a secret plan. Let me go ahead
and do that. And now, let me go to our gallery.

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,550
So, let's search for gopher. We weren't lying.
Here is Aaron's extension. It's getting pretty

7
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,550
good ratings. So, maybe I should report it
as spam now for having a fake description,

8
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,570
but actually what I'm going to do is I'm going
to try to install it, and there we go. So,

9
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,760
I promise that this isn't because we had someone
behind the scene is furiously approving this.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,619
Actually, we think that one of the great strengths
of our gallery is that most approval for most

11
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:14,479
extension is absolutely automatic. So you
don't need to set away around for one of us

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,130
to go and check on it. Now, of course there's
still extensions that might be abusive and

13
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,229
so if we receive a report about that, we'll
go and take it down. Same thing if an extension

14
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,689
violates our terms of service, we'll go and
take it down. But the nice thing is you don't

15
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,999
have to wait for us when you post your extension.
You can just get it live right away. There

16
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:42,599
are a couple of exceptions to this policy
namely: extensions that use native code and

17
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,669
extensions that access the file system. Now,
for security purposes, we do send those to

18
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:52,859
manual review. But this review is as simple
as signing a copy of our terms and sending

19
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,130
that into us. We've seen very few extensions
uses so far. So I think it's a testament to

20
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,119
the flexibility of the system already. And
when those we have seen have gotten approved

21
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,919
very, very quickly. So we think that this
is really a big game for developers. As you

22
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,220
saw, you can write an extension for five minutes.
You can get it up in a minute. And start distributing,

23
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,480
start testing, and start getting users. The
second thing I'd like to tell you about today

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,480
is a little bit about how to make your extension
successful in the gallery. We think there

25
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,400
are three things you can do to make your extension
really do very well. First one, of course,

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,780
is to build a great extension. The second
one is to pay attention to how this extension

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,970
shows up in the gallery. And the last one
is to promote that extension yourself. So,

28
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,570
let's go through those in order. Building
a great extension, that one is pretty obvious.

29
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,180
At Google we're very focused on the user.
We think that the products have best meet

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,670
the needs of the user, at the end of the day
win. And we think the same applies for extensions.

31
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,510
And in fact, we'll be tweaking our ranking
algorithms and the extensions we featured

32
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,260
to constantly try to give an edge to those
extensions that are helping users to really

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:11,620
browse the Web and enjoy the Web better. The
second one is about making your appearance

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,250
in the gallery as good as possible. I will
illustrate with an example. So, let me pull

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,250
up an extension that I find particularly pretty
here, which is the glue extension. The glue

36
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,290
extension allows you to get social recommendations
for movies, books, music, and other media.

37
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,710
And you'll notice that this looks a little
bit different from Aaron's extension, which

38
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,230
Aaron I'm sure will polish his up later on.
You'll see that we've made it incredibly easy

39
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,870
to actually make a very beautiful extension
page. We let you add large screenshots. We

40
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,430
let you add a description and we even let
you add YouTube videos. We think this last

41
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,960
feature adding a YouTube video is going to
be particularly useful for extensions, because

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,810
it's often hard to explain exactly what an
extension does without showing it in action.

43
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,990
And you can do this right on your detail page.
Another thing I'd like you to notice on this

44
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,470
gallery page on this detail page is a little
section here in the corner on the blue background.

45
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,690
We all notice here is that they have a very
nice colorful logo. And they have a short

46
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,279
description that very clearly states what
their extension is going to do and doesn't,

47
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,319
and actually avoids any kind of marketing
speak. Now, the reason this is so important

48
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,539
is that this information is what shows up
in search results and as you browse through

49
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:34,219
the gallery. And so, this is really what the
user bases their decision to click in your

50
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:39,289
extension on. And by keeping this as clear
as possible, that leads you standout among,

51
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:46,289
you know, a field of extensions. The last
part of promoting your--of making your extension

52
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:51,560
successful is to promote it. Now, of course,
as a Chrome Extensions Team, we're going to

53
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,599
do our very best to promote all the great
extensions you write. So, we have featured

54
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,159
extensions, we have top picks, we're going
to do a video in blog post, and many more

55
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:06,240
things. But we also encourage all developers,
such as yourselves to go out and promote the

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,590
extensions to the channels that you have available
to you. One example of that that I think is

57
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,279
great is promoting your Chrome Extension to
users of Chrome that visit your Website. And

58
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,059
with that that does is gives you a starting
user base unless you start rising in our rankings

59
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:27,499
and then that in turn makes us even more likely
to want to showcase you. So we think if you

60
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:32,659
do these three things: build a great extension,
really polish its appearance in the gallery,

61
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:37,169
and then start promoting in, then you'll have
a really good chance of having success, and

62
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:44,169
we think that's a really great opportunity.
So, let me also speak for you that today will

63
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,240
not the first day of extensions we've been
working publicly for a while. It's the first

64
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,169
day that we're out in the open for our beta
users, but it's by no means the last day for

65
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:01,819
extensions. We've got a lot of exciting things
going forward. First obvious one is Mac support.

66
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,830
In fact, extensions already work on the latest
Chromium build. So the latest open source

67
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,830
builds of extensions of Mac have extensions.
And we expect that later this week, we will

68
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:21,089
ship a dev build with extensions enabled on
Mac, and then extensions will come to Mac

69
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:28,430
beta and it's stable in early 2010. The second
part is internationalization. Chrome is already

70
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,539
available in more than 40 languages. And we
have a lot of users internationally. And we

71
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,059
want to make it just as easy for extension
developers to reach our international users

72
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:43,939
as it is for us. We hope that a lot of you
will take advantage of this functionality,

73
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:50,539
which again will be coming in Q1. Finally,
we're going to be adding lots of APIs. I expect

74
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,279
that for every subsequent major release of
Chrome, we will have a new set of APIs for

75
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,449
you to play with. Now, we have some ideas.
We want to add more UI surfaces. We want to

76
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:07,419
add, say, keyboard shortcuts, maybe some way
to interact with network request. But at the

77
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:11,639
end of the day, we're looking for your feedback
to tell us what you want and what's missing

78
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,129
to create your next great idea. And as we're
open source, just join us on the mailing list,

79
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,460
submit any idea, submit a proposal, or even
come help us implement it. So to finish, we've

80
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,650
been out now one day. When we first launched
we had about 300 extensions. The last I checked,

81
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,289
I think we're up to 480. We're hoping we can
have 500 by the end of today. Actually, we

82
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:42,289
must be at 481 by now at least. And so, we've
been really happy with the reception we've

83
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,899
seen so far. As Brian mentioned at the beginning,
we find extensions incredibly important to

84
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,050
the future of Google Chrome and we're hoping
that if you are a user, you'll go out and

85
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,289
try one of the many extensions we have available.
And if you are a developer, you come up with

86
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:05,289
your next awesome idea and build it for Chrome.
Thank you.
One last thing, now, of course, you're welcome

87
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:15,599
to grab something to drink and eat. We've
also set up a few conference rooms around

88
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,099
this area where the demolers [PH], so Xmarks
and eBay and Google Translate will be around

89
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,909
to showcase their extension and chat with
you guys. So, feel free to go find them. Also,

90
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,279
all the extensions team members are here.
We're wearing these shirts. Come find us.

91
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:36,279
We're really excited to talk to you all.
