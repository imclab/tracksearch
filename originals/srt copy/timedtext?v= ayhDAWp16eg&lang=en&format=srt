00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,255

2
00:00:02,255 --> 00:00:03,950
JENNY MURPHY: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,230
Welcome to this week's episode,
or session, I guess,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,830
of the Google+ Platform
Office Hours.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,960
This week we're going to be
talking about snippets.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,540
a lot about snippets.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,770
How you can use them, what you
can use them to do, and other

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,710
cool tools and stuff.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,750
Joining me is Gus.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,950
GUS: I'm Gus, and this is my
first time on Office Hours.

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,530
And I'm pretty new to
the Google+ team

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,010
as a developer advocate.

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,782
And I'll just be trying to
help Jenny out today.

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,960
JENNY MURPHY: And I'm Jenny,
Jenny Murphy, developer,

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,800
programs engineer, on the
Google+ platform.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,590
So I spend a lot of time out
there on the Plus page and the

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,250
forums helping you guys build
awesome stuff, and snippets

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,070
are a part of that.

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,830
So we're going to be talking
about those today.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,530
And just one quick note about
our Office Hours, we do love

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,000
getting feature requests
from you guys.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,500
So feel free to send those
in and ask us.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,080
But in general, we don't
make comments about

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,770
forward-looking things.

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,120
So although we'll definitely
take your feedback and note

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,940
it, there's just not a lot we
can tell you, especially about

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,450
release dates and that
kind of stuff.

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,950
But don't let that stop you from
asking us fun questions.

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,290
Great.

30
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,025
So I guess we should dig
into the snippets.

31
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,250
GUS: So as someone who's
actually relatively new to

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,490
snippets Just getting started,
I kind of would wonder, what

33
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,361
exactly is a snippet?

34
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,850
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great question.

35
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,860
So a snippet is--

36
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,330
well actually, why would I tell
you, when I can show you?

37
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,550
So let me bring up a quick,
cool, demo of what a snippet

38
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,040
is, and what it allows
you to do.

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,160
So here we have a snippet
in action.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,090
So a snippet is a way for you
as a publisher to control.

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,340
[INAUDIBLE]

42
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,850

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,840
So here we have a snippet of
one of my example sites,

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,720
Baking Disasters, as
it appears in a

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
Google web search result.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,449
And you can see that there's an
image specified, a title,

47
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,720
and a description.

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,900
But snippets show up in
a lot of other places.

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,860
Let's take a look at
the page itself.

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,610
We can see that the snippet is
also used in the share box

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,310
when I share the post
on Google+.

52
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,730
Just pull it up here,
and we can see it.

53
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,580

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,240
Let's share that.

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,930
So if I jump on over to Google+
and reload the page--

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,190
the wrong key.

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,140
Reload with the reload button.

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,680
We can see that the
same snippet

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,380
has shown up on Google+.

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,730
So snippets are a tool for you
as a content publisher to

61
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,940
control what shows up
all over the place.

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,400
And snippets aren't just
used at Google.

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,050
If you mark up your content
in the right way, the same

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,670
snippet will show up in all
sorts of different places,

65
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,662
including the three top
major search engines.

66
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:10,695
GUS: So now that we know kind
of what a snippet is

67
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:11,945
[INAUDIBLE]

68
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:19,850

69
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,262
a developer care?

70
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:22,220
JENNY MURPHY: Why would
a developer

71
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,050
care about a snippet?

72
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,240
Well if you don't specify a
snippet on your website,

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,490
[INAUDIBLE]

74
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:50,700

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,550
the controls that you
have in here.

76
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,250
We know that you're always going
to tell us what's really

77
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,850
important about your content,
and snippets are how we give

78
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,220
you that control, and how
you can specify that

79
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,990
for the whole world.

80
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,240
GUS: [INAUDIBLE]

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:15,490

82
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,740
some information about
specifically what that crawler

83
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,520
is looking that.

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,150
JENNY MURPHY: Exactly.

85
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,700
GUS: OK, so then how
do we use them?

86
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,886
How do we get this snippet
functionality to work inside

87
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:27,342
of our sites?

88
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:29,890
JENNY MURPHY: Cool, let's
take a look at that.

89
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,440
We have a lot of cool tools.

90
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,580
Let me switch windows, so I can
show you something neat.

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,840
Here we go.

92
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,920
OK, how do you get snippets
into your site?

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,250
There are a lot of different
ways to control your snippet.

94
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,830
There's a lot of different
ways to specify

95
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,670
the structured markup.

96
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,950
We have a favorite, we have one
that we like a lot called

97
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,330
schema.org.

98
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,690
Schema.org markup is an open
standard way of marking up the

99
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,760
content that you're publishing,
and it has some

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,500
benefit over other techniques.

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,970
Schema.org markup is added to
the content of your site,

102
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,510
instead of adding new content.

103
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,670
So you're just marking up
content that's already there,

104
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,540
which saves you a lot of effort
because you don't have

105
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,250
to add anything new.

106
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,030
It's also an extremely
expressive way of specifying

107
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,760
on the structure of your page.

108
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,390
It's not just about a few fields
up top, although there

109
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,220
are a few important ones.

110
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,600
It's a way of specifying the
content of your page for a

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,670
whole bunch of different
kinds of schemas.

112
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,620
Everything from recipes, like
the one I showed you earlier

113
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,020
for the macaron on Baking
Disasters to locations.

114
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,540
And even get as specific as my
favorite schema, there's

115
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,590
actually a schema.org schema
for structured markup of

116
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,980
volcanoes, which is
pretty awesome.

117
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,130
But anyway, let me show you some
tools that you can use to

118
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,665
get some snippets onto
your content.

119
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:00,850

120
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,010
So flip it over here.

121
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,340
You can see we have a little
snippet code generator that

122
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,440
will show you some skeleton code
for adding snippets to

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,770
your content.

124
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,530
It's on
developers.google.com/plus.

125
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,690
Once you go there, you can click
around and find it on

126
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,483
under Plug-ins, Snippet, or I'll
be adding a link to it in

127
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:24,400
the show notes.

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,950
So once you get to this page,
the first thing you're going

129
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,620
to do is you're going to tell
us what kind of content your

130
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,580
page has on it.

131
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,400
And we've chosen a few really
common schemas, but you can

132
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,550
specify your own in the other
field if you want.

133
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,890
But let's stick to a
simple one for now.

134
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,740
Local business.

135
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,250
So let's say I'm marking up my
local business for Baking

136
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,120
Disasters which is, I guess,
going into business.

137
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,930
It's not just for example
code anymore.

138
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,960

139
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
And let's get an image URL, I
don't actually have one handy,

140
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,340
so I'll use my favorite example
site for links that I

141
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,330
know won't collide with
anyone, example.com.

142
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,860

143
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,410
And this would just be the image
that you want to appear

144
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,450
in the search result, and as
well as wherever else the

145
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,700
snippet will show up.

146
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,450

147
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,070
So in addition to the title
image, you can also specify a

148
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,590
description.

149
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,550
In this exercise I'm just
typing it in, but you'll

150
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,120
probably have content that
correlates to the description

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,600
on the page itself, usually
an intro paragraph, or

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,560
something like that.

153
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,260
When baking goes all wrong.

154
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:42,030
GUS: So something I noticed,
Jenny, in the image URL you

155
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,120
used a site that's external
to bakingdisasters.com.

156
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,480
Is that perfectly acceptable
along the way, or is it sort

157
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,580
of a best practice to stick
to the stuff that's

158
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,520
within you're own site?

159
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,110
JENNY MURPHY: So there are
always going to be cases where

160
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,360
your image [INAUDIBLE]

161
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:04,707

162
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,300
structure and especially
to a lot of you

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,770
publishers out there.

164
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,150
So we allow it, but make sure
this is your image.

165
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,585
Make sure that it's something
you control.

166
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,240

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,000
Posting it from a domain you
control's important.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,965
So I'm demoing a bad
practice here.

169
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,300
GUS: The last thing you'd want
to happen is for your images

170
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,900
to get switched in your schema
behind your back.

171
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,942
JENNY MURPHY: That would sure
be a shame, wouldn't it.

172
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,990
GUS: OK, really good to know,
just something I was thinking.

173
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,186
JENNY MURPHY: Good question.

174
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,322
GUS: Cool.

175
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:35,929
JENNY MURPHY: So let's see
what we have here.

176
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,250
So what's happening here is as
I'm filling out these fields,

177
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,350
there's some example schema.org
mark up showing up

178
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,039
in the little pane on
the right side.

179
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,830
And this is a very simple
example of how to do a

180
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,370
schema.org markup to
get you started.

181
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,740
In this case, we're adding an
items scope to the HTML

182
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,180
element of the page, and this
is where we tell whatever's

183
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,300
parsing that structured markup
what kind of content we're

184
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,910
marking up.

185
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,850
And then we've filled out a few
fields here below which

186
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,180
correlate to those text boxes
that I typed stuff into just a

187
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,280
moment ago.

188
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,100
There's the name, there's the
image, and there's the

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,350
description.

190
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,210

191
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,840
And this is the basic amount of
markup that you need to get

192
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,100
control over just changing
the image, the title, the

193
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,910
description and Google+,
Google web search, and

194
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,628
everywhere else is processing
this markup.

195
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,940
Yep.

196
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,320
But you can go a lot
deeper than that.

197
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,580
So let's dive into schema.org
a little further.

198
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,410
I showed you a few schema
types here, but there's

199
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,520
actually a whole bunch
more available.

200
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,150
If you just go to aptly-named
schema.org, you can find a

201
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,230
whole hierarchy of different
schemas.

202
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,220
Whenever you use a specific
schema you can also use any of

203
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,120
the different subtypes that
are under it in the tree.

204
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,400
So, let me zoom into
this a little bit.

205
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,787

206
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:02,070
I do not know what I did.

207
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,920
Let me escape out of here.

208
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,950
I've gotten into an
accessibility mode that I'm

209
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,790
not familiar with.

210
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,680
GUS: Click on the magnifying
glass.

211
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,630
JENNY MURPHY: On the
magnifying glass?

212
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,385
GUS: It's in the left
of your screen.

213
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:11,850
There you go.

214
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,110
JENNY MURPHY: Ah, it's been a
while since I've used this.

215
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,590
GUS: Just hit right there.

216
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,272
JENNY MURPHY: There we go.

217
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:17,140
GUS: Close it.

218
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,130
JENNY MURPHY: Close it?

219
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,560
GUS: Save.

220
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,470
JENNY MURPHY: Oh,
thank you Gus.

221
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,720
Saved again.

222
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040

223
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,940
So here is the schema.org
list of schemas.

224
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,290
Whenever you use a specific
schema-- like we were just

225
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,540
using local business--

226
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:38,450

227
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,840
there's actually a whole
bunch of different

228
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,350
sub schemas of that.

229
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,490
And you can use that wherever
that would be--

230
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,020
whatever is most specific
to your content.

231
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,580
There's a whole bunch
of cool ones here.

232
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,480
One of my favorites
is tire shop.

233
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,180
So all you tire shops out there
who have pages, or all

234
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,680
of you content producers that
have pages that describe tire

235
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,630
shops, can actually very
specifically describe all the

236
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,820
metadata specific to your tire
shop, which is pretty cool.

237
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,720

238
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,750
And when we arrive on one of
these schemas, we see there's

239
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,550
a whole bunch more fields.

240
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,060
There's the fields at the top,
which are pretty much the same

241
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,220
as the fields that we've filled
out on the tool, but

242
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,200
there's a whole bunch of other
stuff down here below that

243
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,680
describes stuff specific
to our schema.

244
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,550
When you're marking up your
content we recommend that in

245
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,040
addition to the basic fields
that the tool helped you get

246
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,310
started with that you mark
up everything that

247
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,150
you possibly can.

248
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,910
You want to give us as much
detail as possible, because

249
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,240
we're starting to use
that detail in

250
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,410
more and more places.

251
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,760
And there's going to be really
cool stuff that results.

252
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,860
So even if you're marking up a
volcano, and volcano is not a

253
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,850
schema that we do a whole lot
with right now, someday, once

254
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,120
we have volcano aware software,
we might be doing

255
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,110
some really cool stuff with
that particular markup.

256
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,360
[INAUDIBLE]

257
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,954

258
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:03,960
GUS: --volcanoes everywhere and
do whatever we need to do

259
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,175
in our plus apps.

260
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:06,790
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, you can
do the best possible

261
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,940
sharing with them.

262
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,080
There's actually one specific
case where we're starting to

263
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,100
use a lot of the more advanced
features [INAUDIBLE]

264
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,820

265
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,260
GUS: Yay, victory.

266
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,110
JENNY MURPHY: --popularly.

267
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,130
Where am I hiding it?

268
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,440
It's in one of these minimized
Windows, I'll find it.

269
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,150

270
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,450
Let me open another one.

271
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:42,220

272
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,980
Cool.

273
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,380
OK, it came up.

274
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,390
So here's the Google+ history
beta web interface.

275
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,720
So the Google+ history API, as
you may have heard, or may

276
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,110
have not heard, just recently
entered developer preview.

277
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,820
So it's not out for general
availability yet, but it's a

278
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,580
great example of us doing
something cool with schema.org

279
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,830
markup that we weren't
doing before.

280
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,230
It's also an example of where
we're, for the first time,

281
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,760
starting to use a lot of the
other details of the schema

282
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,260
markup that you apply
to your pages to do

283
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,060
more expressive stuff.

284
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,810
So when you create a moment
with a history API, that

285
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,060
[INAUDIBLE]

286
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:37,060

287
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,520
doesn't really express it much,
there's a potential for

288
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,260
cool stuff to happen here
someday, which is always

289
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,510
pretty awesome.

290
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,366

291
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,382
GUS: Exciting history stuff.

292
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:52,990
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

293
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,975
GUS: We all look forward to
advancements in history.

294
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:57,660
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, it's
an exciting API.

295
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,300
I'm really excited about it.

296
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,690
So let's say you've added a
bunch of schema.org markup to

297
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,740
your pages, which you were going
to ask me about, but I

298
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,075
derailed us a little it.

299
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:12,236
GUS: So how do we add schema.org
markup to our

300
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,160
pages, Jenny?

301
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,850
JENNY MURPHY: Thank you, Gus.

302
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,380
So I already talked a little bit
about how we add it with

303
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,910
those tools.

304
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,720
Once we've added it, how
do we verify that

305
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,970
it's actually working?

306
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,800

307
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,520
So let's take a trip back to
the Baking Disasters page.

308
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,448

309
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,540
GUS: This says macaron.

310
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,354
I thought it was macaroon, as
opposed to one or the other.

311
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,580
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, I was
actually calling this macaroon

312
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,210
until I went to the party where
we baked it, and I was

313
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,530
fortunate enough that a
professional pastry chef

314
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,330
joined us, who was very helpful
until he got a little

315
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,230
distracted by beer,
and was unable to

316
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,640
help us with our macaroons.

317
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,400
One of the reasons it became
a baking disaster.

318
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,989
Macaron is apparently a more
specific kind [INAUDIBLE]

319
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:08,555

320
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:09,130
GUS: --baking disaster
that would create.

321
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,500
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah,
I kind of had some

322
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,925
potential for exploding.

323
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,020
You can read more on
Baking Disasters.

324
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,390
Anyway, I've added a
bunch of schema.org

325
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,690
markup to this site.

326
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,780
As I showed you before, if we
want to validate that the

327
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,090
schema.org markup works, the
easiest and most obvious way

328
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,480
is you just go and you hit the
button, and you verify that

329
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,170
the snippet looks correct.

330
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,980
But this only allows you to
verify some of the markup.

331
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,490
We have some more advanced tools
that are pretty cool.

332
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,260
We have the rich snippet
testing tool.

333
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,710
This one's been around
for quite a while.

334
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,830
But it still works, and
it's still great.

335
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,270
So let me copy the URL.

336
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,090
And we can go to this tool,
paste in our URL, or you can

337
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,960
paste in the HTML content, if,
for example, you have a page

338
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,820
that's behind a firewall
right now.

339
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,780
And you can get a report, you
can get a preview of the

340
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,360
snippet as it will appear in
your Google web search result.

341
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,720
And you get a really detailed
breakdown of all the kind of

342
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,780
content we've pulled
out of there.

343
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,870
So in cases where we may opt
to pick one kind of markup

344
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,860
over another, this tool allows
you to see all of it, kind of

345
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,800
like a neat [INAUDIBLE].

346
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,770
So it's a great place
to start, but it can

347
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,490
kind of be a hassle.

348
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,630
So one of the developers on our
team created a new tool.

349
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,650
He made a Chrome extension
that does a

350
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,380
lot of the same stuff.

351
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,350
It's called--

352
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,070
what is it called?

353
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,890
Beta markup, or--

354
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,650
I can't quite see it.

355
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,140
But I'll be mentioning it in
the show notes, micro beta.

356
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,070
GUS: Micro beta.

357
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,070
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, and what
it does is whenever you're

358
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,130
visiting a page you can hit a
button, and you can see an

359
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,250
output of all the schema.org
markup on that page.

360
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,400
So it's a great way, when
surfing around on your site,

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,610
to validate the markup is all
happy and presenting the way

362
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,860
you want it to.

363
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,730

364
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,980
Cool.

365
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,910

366
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,360
GUS: I don't have that many
more questions, actually.

367
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,050
You've answered a lot of the
initial reservations and

368
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,465
interest that I had
around schema.

369
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:04,950
JENNY MURPHY: So you going to
go schema you're site now?

370
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,200
GUS: I'm going to go
schema my site.

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,330
JENNY MURPHY: Or have
you already?

372
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,510
GUS: Maybe I already did.

373
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,470
JENNY MURPHY: Maybe
you already did.

374
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,220
GUS: Poorly.

375
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,564
I need to go back and
do it better.

376
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,610
JENNY MURPHY: What are you
going to do better?

377
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,640
GUS: I'm going to make sure that
I'm using all the right

378
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,805
types for my posts and other
things that are on my site.

379
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,770
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

380
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,369
OK.

381
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,270
Well that wraps up our kind
of faux interview here.

382
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,890
Thanks Gus.

383
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,560
Now we're going to go and we're
going to answer some of

384
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,200
the questions, if you've asked
any in the forums.

385
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,780
So let's go take a look on the
Google+ developers' page and

386
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,455
see what you guys have been
chatting about while we've

387
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:38,705
been babbling here.

388
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:42,290

389
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,240
And I don't really see that many
questions about snippets

390
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,390
or the Google+ platform.

391
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,870
Just one comment about
cameras and mics.

392
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,640
We'll get that worked out.

393
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,050
We're still working
on the studio.

394
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,070
The quality seems a lot better,
but we're still

395
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,410
working out some kinks.

396
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,420
So bear with us during these few
weeks of Office Hours as

397
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,810
we get that stuff all smoothed
out from a technical

398
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,930
perspective.

399
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,060
But it looks like there's not
a lot of conversation about

400
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,860
snippets out there right now,
so I guess we might as well

401
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,770
wrap it up.

402
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,200
Sound good?

403
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,515
GUS: Sounds good.

404
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,450
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

405
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:25,390
So just checking for comments
in other places.

406
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,560
Well, thanks for joining
us, everyone.

407
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,100
So what we did in a quick
recap, we talked about

408
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,110
snippets, what they are, how you
can put them on your site,

409
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,460
and what are the cool stuff that
results from you adding

410
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,370
that markup to your page.

411
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,000
So tune in next week, and we'll
be talking about some

412
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,260
other developer topics.

413
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,960
You'll be able to find our
sessions announced on the

414
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,290
Google+ developers' page a few
days before each session with

415
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,940
the detail topic.

416
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,570
And you can also go to Google
Developers Live, and you can

417
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,590
see several of our sessions
that are upcoming and what

418
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,080
kind of topics might be
of interest to you.

419
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,500
So I guess that's all
we have for today.

420
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,670
GUS: That's all we've got.

421
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,640
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks everyone.

422
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,890
Goodbye.

423
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,500
