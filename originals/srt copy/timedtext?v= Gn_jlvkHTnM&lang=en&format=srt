Hi, my name is Nick, and I am the product
manager for Google Chrome's extension system.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,910
Today, I'd like to show you how to publish
your extension in the Google Chrome Extension

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,320
gallery.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,250
Here on my desktop, I've got a new extension
that I've created. The first thing I'd like

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,619
to do is check that the manifest has a title,
a short description, and an icon. It's very

6
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,789
important to pay attention to these, as they'll
influence how likely people are to pick my

7
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,940
extension in the gallery.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,190
Next I'm going to zip up this folder. There
are a number of free programs out there that

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:45,390
will do this for you. The gallery will require
me to upload this zip file, not a packaged

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,270
extension.

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:53,270
Next, I go to the gallery site at chrome.google.com/extensions.
I click the developer link here in the left

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,579
navigation, which takes me to my developer
dashboard. Here I can see all the extensions

13
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,220
that I've previously uploaded.

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,040
I click add new item, and the first thing
I have to do is upload the zip file I created

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,790
earlier.

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,530
At this point, I get taken to the edit page,
where I can enter a more detailed description.

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,830
I've already prepared this, so I'm just going
to paste it here. I can also add a support

18
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,830
link, which is very important to avoid users
posting bug reports in my reviews.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
I'm also going to add some nice screenshots.
Again, the nicer my extension looks, the bigger

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,770
the chance that someone will install it.

21
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,150
I can also specify a youtube video. Ideally
this would be a screencast of my extension

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,140
in action.

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,570
Finally, when all is ready, I hit publish
and get taken to a preview page. Here I double-check

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,100
my information and confirm.

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,210
In just a few minutes, my extension is live
in the Google Chrome Extension gallery! I

26
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,720
hope to see yours there soon too.
